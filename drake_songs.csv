[Bridge]
The V-O-Y I'm talking to you
And both them record deals that ain't never go through
OK Voyce, we know you was a snitch
But you don't get your boys back like that
Still need a ride, you ain't gettin paid
And Taj got you at them shoots wearing pink shades
OK Voyce, always knew you a bitch
But I ain't know you got down like that

[Verse 1]
I hear you issuing threats, you need to kill the jive talk
Furthest thing from street bruh, that's why I call you sidewalk
We here waiting, if you stupid then try it
How you gon' knock me out lookin' like Snoop on a diet?
Uh, listen slim fast, we all know that
The only time that you raisin' up the shooters is in the gym class
This ain't dooms day, this today and after
This a diss track from your sister's favorite rapper

[Interlude]
Oh man... Yo V-O man let's reminisce for a second man, we been through a lot of shit man. Like um, you remember when, you remember when you used to kick it at Jazzy's studio yo? And you used to make fun of Rahmel and say that he looked so old that if you punched him in the face, his head might turn to dust yo. I remember that, and you used to make of Diggs too man and now you like, standing side by side with him cuttin' records, I think that shit funny man.

Do What You Do by Drake,2006-02-14 00:00:00,Room for Improvement,20,"25 ContributorsDo What You Do Lyrics[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Verse 1]
Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin'
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin'
A lot of records from here, they get no play
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it
Long as I got me some heat through the winter
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner
'Cause me and 1da trying to get at your girl
If you see her tell this nigga got some beats Imma send her

[Verse 2]
Check, the verses I'm writin', you might wanna learn it
You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it
So now you at the store for some blank CDs
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with
To the people that ignored me before this
This one is for you as a song re-recorded
Funny thing is, you just notice me now
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is
And I'll write a sixteen and record it
The waiting is over I think music needed
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded
People in the South want it chopped and screwed
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it
Like a single with only backgrounds
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit
Finally here I'ma star with the timin'
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin'
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin'
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all

Do's what you do, I do what I do
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall

I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all
You waiting for the spring, and I'm gettin' it in the fall
But uh, do what you do what you, I do what I do
Do's what you do, I do what I do

[Bridge]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to kick some new school lines
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back

[Chorus]
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall
My niggas chill, why you niggas wanna ball
I'm satisfied with a little, why you niggas want it all

Yeah, Ren, M.O.F, Haha
It's Drake man, it's Drake man.Yeah
Ayo Ren this that gritty shit here man
I'ma have to tell them about I been through on this know what I mean
HO! Southern Smoke!!!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Very few give you that truth, it's either they can't do it with lyrics
Or can't do it in spirit, they cancel what they doin'
The samples that they usin', can't get through the clearin'
I'll handle it since they just can't get you to hear it
My father's early careerin' forced my parents to split up
My mother was a teacher, my father was kind of fed up
With just being a florist, so the choir sang his chorus
And he got back into doin' what he was doing before us
Because money is an issue, your son, he gon' miss you
And plus you got a wife at home cause mommy still exist too
Now you lookin' for exes, you ain't never expect this
You end up doing time, and me, I end up with a step-sis
Nobody passing judgment, they question where the drugs went
You know I hold you down because without you, I'd be a wasn't
And mommy I'mma support her, I keep it all in order
See her with tears in her eyes or you arrested at the border
But

I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder
Young black man dodge your bullets trying to get older
And you wonder why we turn to drugs and chain smokers
IT'S STRESS MY NIGGA!!!
I'm just tryna live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 2: Drake]
This is my life, and so the rest has kinda been cool
Question what I been through
I write a verse addressin' it
And yes I might offend you
Picture when I was in school
Me being the closest thing to black
And guess what rap music what I was into
Rest of the kids were sheltered
I never liked to fight
But when someone called me a ""nigga""
I'd punch em I couldn't help it
Now I'm grown I can say what it is
It's parents that got these Black and Filipino nannies raisin' they kids
And your daddy want it very right
I make you happy, plus I'm Jewish, he don't approve
I think he want you to marry white
He want Sinatra at the wedding, not Barry White
Cause black is black honey, even if he's very light
And so I never been for dinner at they places
Always brutally honest, and so I pin it to they faces
I live it so the case is, whether Drake is
Way ahead of his time, or inquisitive and racist
[Hook: Nickelus F]
I got stress on my shoulders
Trying to keep my heart pure but this world is makin' it colder

Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!
I'm just trying to live my life cuz
Make a little money, find a bunny
To make my wife cuz BO!, BO!, BO!, BO!

[Verse 3: Drake]
Am I hot as the rest? should I strive for my spot as the best?
Like girls with Double D's, I got a lot on my chest
There's questions that need to be answered that's not on the test
Instead of starin' at quizzes now it's models with breasts
And yes, when I'm dismissed after a tedious listen
I sit at home and say I should of been a pediatrician
Homie, I probably could've been on TV consistent
An artist like Pablo, maybe Petey's assistant
And my mindset is come and get me
I'm all alone at home with my mom and grandma and ain't nobody runnin' with me
So, if you got the heart to come in here and kill a lady
Daughter, and her grandson, nigga get the handgun
If not, you gon make me call the burbs out in Richmond
That have you niggas laying out on the curb, they some hitmen
Last couple of months I done probably been around the world and back
And I don't wanna question half the places Nick been

Lady, you say I stay in the house til four
We don't even go out no more
Its always the same eh
Always complainin, it's obvious baby
I guess you don't watch the news
You see theres a lot to lose
Cuz we got a baby and people are shady

[Bridge: Drake]
My generation is changin
Aside from the fact
The dealers have customers they provide with the crack
Front of the buses taken
And we deny it from the back
You can die where you from, or die where you at

[Chorus: Drake]
Don't put it past them
I don't think that they understood
My friends they ain't even sit in the class when they should
He can come pick you up
If your dads in the hood
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good good good

[Verse 2: Slakah]
Lady, somebody shot up the place right by
Where I work and I think they might
Be coming for me next, klend me ya Kleenex

Still gotta go out tonight
Cuz I gotta feed you, I hope that I see you again

Lately I don't know about the friends that I hang with
I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish
Depends on if they saving all the tops on Pepsi
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis
Depends on what they do to achieve that
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at
Specially if they know where they girl live
Get the info, leave with ya money man, thats how the world is
Thats how niggas puttin' they dirt down
Streets are seedy, I call em sesame
It's Ernie and Bert's town
'specially when these youngins get turned down for work opportunities
Next week same place'll get burnt down
Coincidink? not likely not a chance
How can we be so aware of these problems and not advance?
At least start put a bid in, its hard just to fit in
A lot of people only play they part when they spittin
But I don't think that they understood
They using this darkness for penetration in the hood
I took the ivory way in and yes I'm glad that keenan could

[Verse 1: Drake]
Chances are most of the days you was lying around
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in
I take cues from my big boy Popz
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch
They getting foul on the star
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar
Get it?
Guess not
Picture me not strive
To land in the top ten slip in the top five
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me?
Nowadays I peak they interests
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed
Money making brothers should take notes
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat
Somebody get the waiter
They need a second plate a this knowledge
If you ain't got it you could catch it later
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig?
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin'
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh?
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh?

Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage
Maybe they can bring they career back
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap!
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!

Uh, I'm bringing back hip hop
Me and my nigga Drake

[Verse 1: Nickelus F]
Aiight let me take my jacket off
Unlace the Timbs, here again comes the jabberjaw
This time I'm blabbing on
These rappers that feel a certain way but they give me dap and all
Mad cuz the freestyle iller than they whole catalog
I got the gift like Santa Claus
Flow got spring like a catapult
Matter fact the flow Supreme like Diana Ross
I'm at the do' like a deer with the antlers off
Niggas acting like Scummy was they nigga
Wouldn't even give my man a 12 bar feature
I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya
I said nah lets keep it peaceful
My nigga was a true weed source
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off
A real street dog
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off
We have an impostor, alert the doctor
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit
My crew lie you guys into ditches
I said it and meant it the Scorpio's Mind has many dimensions
I'll say it in intent, sentence, indent, on instant pimpin
Hope your listenin' to my diction
If you are then you now should be itchin'
That it's crack we placed in your stereo system
Yeah, I be at your burial trippin'

I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty
Disliked by some, but confronted by none

And compared to D
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader
And when the psychic get to touching my palm
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over
Let me assist you like a specialist
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist
Which means if shit goes bad I say, ""I expected this""
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler
You got rappers being repetitive actors

Same four G's from last night (Money)
You cannot take that from me

[Verse 1]
Hey yo I'm movin' on up, excuse a moi, pardon it's me
There's a new chapter to life that I'm starting to see
And I'ma make and spend money to the hardest degree
And on the low I probably mimic every artist I see
I need a house, a wifey, a nice watch and a lot of cake
I can't lie, there's certain figures I gotta make
And for my family, this a shot that I gotta take
Cause where I live there's nobody as hot as Drake
Which basically means, who's faith in his team
Will resort to new cars, briefcases with cream
Tryna find a space in the jeans for placing the green
And a watch get they attention, the bracelet's clean
I'm stayin' the music, wifey kinda need to be a band lover
I keep it flow, an old school like your grandmother
I'm a tan brother, they use rubber bands to keep his money intact, if you don't like it you should ban rubber

[Verse 2]
These days I really can't break 20s, hunnid and make money, money
Every month, the government will take money from me
Make 750, look how quicky I spent that, don't call me broke cause I strictly  resent that
Last my P had to flip my the rent, because the tax bracket I'm in's is 50 percent flat
All because of Ebay givin' me leway, basically do the PayPal, I need a raise now
Seems every time a nigga stop and he eat, I end up always tryna shop and compete
They know a nigga 'bout it when it's in his size and cops it in more colors than Popsicle Pete
Till I'm piled to the top with receipts, trust the store and I don't understand less is more
Wanna get 'em to the point where they owe me, and they gon' see Drake's on his JOB, it's like...

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now-a-days you sayin' that I should go Jermaine, I should go Pharrell
Either or my nigga, make sure you don't get shelled
(Right) Make sure your money's right and they do a promotion well
So you could get checks cut like Benedict in Ocean's Twelve
This ain't Brad Pitt, I gotta admit
I'm sick of seeing chicks in that Louis V and that Plaid shit, cause it's a bad fit
They say my father lives through me, so this is just basically how my dad spit
I know my cash come quick when it's sunny
You know a girl is special if I stick with her honey
If it wasn't for dummies chick would still have money
And if it wasn't for money Nick would still have Skummy
So, guess it's kinda like a gift and a curse
To jip money is easier than liftin' a purse
If you pick the wrong mother who'll snatch you, run for cover
A week later you might find ya click in a hearse, boy!

So with that and my amounts tryin to make it just to burn it

Take that dick, put to your lips and insert it
Where the hell is self-respect go when them checks show?

That new Benz’s comin out, put some 'umph' in your switch, trick

So get up, do the hand job, and some head for him

So keep my dough off your head, fuck with do on your head (Money)
Now you really got money on your mind, nigga

Anybody thats special
You know I wanna be honest with you women so I'mma start off like this

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh look, I'm bold from the get go, go by the title of Drake
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressing a few
I finesse then I groove
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past
Now get a rating thats less than a 2
Its true, I been talking to Aleshia, Keisha and Nadia
And Shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's
Payback, to the same chicks from way back
Never call, now they wanna be where I stays at
Now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward
And pass me, classy, something like Drew Lord
A new me, cool, see I never get around
If I dont change now I dont think I'll ever settle down
Even if I gotta travel a bit

Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh

Or you can take it to gold black
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase
I mean I had my share of women
Now a nigga gettin' girls for days
With most of 'em its seemin' like they world is staged
But from Georgia to BK and all around the world
Get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche

Still the new version of fresh needa a Nia or Tyra
So we can be Jenny and Swayze
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me
Or maybe it's karma
They say is a charmer
Halfway to a knight so I stay in a armor
I'm fire on the move
A tire looking smooth
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve
I'm special
Like kids in a graduating class
Having more trouble than others when adding basic math
Need you to be special like areba to cootmore
Double O, top secret agents with suits on
Something so deep it da drown me
Friends are some cool dudes
I vouch for the people around me
On your end its simple

My man Smalls is out there, down south
Same time, reppin' for Toronto, Canada

So this right here, listening to right now is the official Southern Smoke Special Edition
I call it the ""Room For Improvement"" mixtape, cause I'm not perfect
And I bet neither are you if you listening

Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven
A show of hands who's in?
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot

I wake up, got money on mind
And I can't get off so I got to get on my grind
Got to get all my ducks in line
My bills in order crackers taking orders
For niggas in the race I got water
For niggas with hate I got llamas
Tissues for they mama
I'm flyer than Aladdin on a carpet
Saw A Whole New World when I made my profits
And my jasmine is a rapping
I do it the best, These niggas ain't smashing
Raw dog action
I impregenate the beat everytime I speak
A seed of my speech concives and MC! (Ho!)
Similar to me( yes),so we ain't' got to write just think
Keep it in the head like T
Spit listerine on the beat
Flossin' diamonds and me
Now peep the way I deliver on the beat
Is what you lack yeah that's why I'm so SWEET!
That's why yo chick want to pump me (right)
She want to be the chick from the other guy
Wanna be a lover I chuckle I laugh
As soon as you turn yo back I'm smashing
Hey I'm the other guy
Now you wanna rumble why

Roll you down the mountain and let your tumble drop
Throwback line for those who been listening (Uh!)

That's why I roll up and tend to get high
Cause my arms won't extend to the sky
Peer pressure always make me feel lesser than a 10 in they eyes
So I can only grab my pen and advise
Street legends and chicks seem to wonder
Exactly who I am
You know me if you had a job at 16 and under yup
It's Drake and Saint Nick
Take a whiff of this and faint quick
Off a sample of the flow patient
But I don't lie to rhymers
I strip walls and apply the primer
If there's a wall I'm gon' try to climb-aaa
Without a graded rope
Our navy seal Buddies yelling slurs at me
I'm always gon find another way to go
I'm minty fresh with the Green like I'm made a bathing scope
No bathing ape but I'm clean Like I'm made of soap
Begging for the fire
Buglars in hear we
We all good in the fam we like Meagan and limiya
I dress like Lou, I sell verses to label
And they give me the next joint
To sound less like you
That's something I had to say before
I'm real picky with real with lyrics
So don't use joints you probably would pay me for
I ain't' a heat busser
What up to Denik Rusha and Bei Major, Trey Songz, the street's Usher
Leak tracks and heat wax and he bust ya
And then sign ya
This is a reminder
This along the lines of Thrill is Gone still the song
I'mma mention Jay even though I feel it's wrong
We gave good ambition homegirl couldn't listen
Now she want the Snackpack back and her pudding's missin'
Bring the topic back
Please don't stop the track
Tropicana never got the hammer by my jock in-fact, I keep my money there
Mixtapes where I top em at
DJ Smallz.com you can shop at that
Speak of shopping I'm tryna get a label deal
Tryna live my dreams while awake, tryna make the fables real
No stealing cable trying to have my cable still
Better yet stolen, my grammar is golden
My grammer go harder than most rappers
There's a certain female rapper I will expose and
For once I think you should tell yo mouth to get to closing
No I didn't pen that Freestyle shit
I got a session with Digs so the beef I'm gone end that

Let me show you what it is
I was birthed up top but was raised at the bottom of the map
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap
If you lookin' for the good then we got 'em in the trap like, ooh wee
Took 'em from white sneaks to Louis
This metaphor might sound a little confusin' but
Y'all don't really know me if you know me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I done come all way from the Days Inn
And all the hotels that I stayed in
And I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good
And now I say it's sittin' at amazin'
Girls tryna SoHo lobby us
Hear 'em all screamin' then it's probably us
But I can't blame females
Females can't really ignore somethin' this obvious
What you really expect when I strut through town?
Two or three days, I shut you down
Chilin' with the homie Trey Songz
You call him the prince, he rep two up, two down
Anyone I know get used to me
I'm far from the man that I used to be
And I don't ever really kick game
I know you find it impressive whenever you introduced to me
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that
Need good lovin' I'm providin' that
Understand that I'm worldwide, you get it how you want it wherever you be residin' at
'Cause I do things from the M-town
To the UK and from Spain back out to Texas
This album's for my fans, but, yo, this hook is for my exes

You had a chance, now it's gone, gone for you
Oh, you had a man now you don't, now you don't

Ain't ya never seen a youngin' so fly? (Probably not)
Lookin' for someone your type
I done left behind the love of my life (She gone)

Don't matter skirts, dresses or jeans

And I'm flexin' on my ex if you know what I mean

Until they slip up and then they break out
But it's another story over here at Drake's house
'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm draped out
And I'm leaned back, scopin'
Lookin' for a woman that I should wife
Who got just the right amount of loyalty
Yeah but is still anticipatin' us livin' the good life
We go LA, VA, NY, TO
Sunshine and that heatstroke
And them fur hoods in that deep snow
We have breakfast in the bedroom
Break bread downstairs in the basement
Since Jay and Kellz ain't doin' they thing no more
Guess me and the boy Songz the replacement

You only show your face 'cause you know that I'm a star girl
What you tryna to make it, don't ever mistake it

Shake up the world, that is what I'm about to do
And homie, you ain't even on my altitude
I'm tellin you, I got enough clout for two
And like a nigga turned Blood, I came out the blue
They like, ""Damn who's Drake, where's wheelchair Jimmy at?""
On my Chris Brown shit, I'm still here, gimme that
I'm cutting lights out like it's bedtime
These other rappers lukewarm like red wine
The truth hurts so please don't rub it in
I'm not signed yet, so I'm still budgeting
I'm like Jeopardy, I'm still buzzin in
Every city that you got a nephew or a cousin in
I miss cake these days
I can't even afford a mistake these days
All of my favorite girls miss Drake these days
Please don't take offense to my ways
Cause I need drug money Who got drug money?
I am talkin ""white Phantom sittin' on dub"" money
I am talkin ""cold champagne at the club"" money
And no I ain't emotional, but baby I love money
To all these A&R's that's playin' stars
Why you gotta act dumb? (dumb)
Your girl know how I beat it like a flat drum
And spit dirty like I'm chewing on black gum

Tryna make some cheese off a single is a process
Get it? Kraft, single, cheese, process
Sit back and admire the talent that I possess
Top notch, no less, oh yes, I'm known in the city
But need to bust out like a model that show chest
Cause you deal with agents from check collections
I'm keepin' it cleaner than Little X direction
And baby girl, if you don't like me, it's prolly due to the fact
That you are les like NextSelection
The city is mine, I control this, you know this
Cause you are nothing like it and I'm so this, the coldest
I'm in Jamaica, docked at the bay, what up Otis?
I'm back with the form like Obus, I go, yeah
And I'mma teach it so you learn right
You can't come on this ride, you need to earn height
With no hydro bill, I let the lights burn out
And after that I take 'em back like returned flights, yeah
You can't miss the boy
Me and Rich united like van Nistelrooy
Bar Mitzvah kid, get your hits destroyed
Cause I keep it under wraps like Christmas toys
No witnesses, no mistresses
This the present and I'm a show you what gifted is, mayne
Keep it real, no other youngin's as hot as me
You a Gucci groupie, my nigga, and I'm a prodigy

Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend
Back again return of the mack again
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me
Little me
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be
One of the best, decisions you've made
I'm sonnin' them all I live in the shade
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be
But now I need a culprit
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with
Friends that I ball with
Hear me, Trey's girl? Go and get you some Fall shit
Sweetie I am a track's demise
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies
With a military jacket and some packed supplies
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive
And all these a-list parties you fraternize
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties
But you don't never act surprised
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint

Take me where the women be, I won't lose
Drake take Patrón to the face 'til he wasted
I'm blowin 'til I'm gon' outta space in the Matrix
Call me Mr. Anderson huh
I'm ramblin'
But at the same time I'm spittin' a flame rhyme
Baby what's your name? They call me the game mind
Most valuable player baby listen it's game time
We could take a couple shots break down ya d's
Take it to the hole post up on me
Let me fill the arena, I'll be Gilbert Arenas
Somethin' like a wizard when I give ya what I give ya

When I give ya what I give ya (You gon' like that)
When I give ya what I give ya (You throw it right back)
It ain't a woman in the world that can doubt that (oh)

Easy to Please by Drake (Ft. Richie Sosa),2007-09-01 00:00:00,Comeback Season,4,"17 ContributorsEasy to Please Lyrics[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, look

[Verse 1: Drake]
Me and Sos, we from two different walks of life
Mutually we understand there's a problem, we don't talk to vice
The watch is yellowy-green
That's sum awkward ice
I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write
Inspire no-talent rappers to get off the mic
And I could pick you up from work when you get off tonight
Drop you at the house soon as you get off the pipe, man
I flow so cool like autumn nights
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light
But don't try and tell me that a dolphin's white
Mislead Drake, that is not at all polite
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows
Bet I get a co-sign somethin' like no time
They'll be tryna sub a nigga in like Quizno's

[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel
Nigga my drink, my smoke, a bird on E
And somethin' heavy on my waist man, I'm easy to please
I need my moms, my pa, a bottle of cliqua
The whole ATF you know who we are
My women, my money, and leave me the keys
Of somethin fast and I'm good man I'm easy to please

I never lived in a fancy house
I grew up where the guns pop and the child molesters pulled the candy out
So I never really had a chance to escape
Fast forward to '07, ain't nothin' much changed
The D still scope the crip
And the mics ain't really that much bigger than the roaches is
And told the same damn sad story, different publishin'
D boys jugglin', single mother strugglin'
The media try to cover it
But the Cottonelle two-ply in your neighbor's house, I'm on some other shit
Me and Drake from two different walks of life
But both understand the pressure from the sharks that bite
My left arm's like David Wells
My right arm's like Holliday, so I'm probably lookin' at 8 to 12
For just tossin' one of my close friends a bag of chips
Shit, I know they want me locked up

[Chorus: Richie Sosa & Drake]
All I need is some weight, my scale, some money for bail
A lil' booth at the club for the whole cartel

Yeah I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time
Like what it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then but, probably tell you a lil' somethin' now

[Verse 1: Drake]
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin'
I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels
And they silencing you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track
Well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch blue and green diamonds I call it the Earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years it's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap it's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' drinks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like [Andreena harmonizes]
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring '07 second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is wack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at a dinner table
And say ""My baby's famous and I knew it"" (yeah)
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I've drawn it and drew it 'til the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out

Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progressed
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video
Which made everything right with X (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Far too many rappers and not enough ___
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
Day care play pen drop out
To grade ten drop out
To summer '05 with the grey Benz drop out

Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the Artful Dodger
Shola Ama
I told her I'mma
'Bout to get my run on so hold the commas
Times've changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And ""Hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest""
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam

Anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive

Yeah one more time 'fore we turn the lights out ladies and gentleman

It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it?
Your weekly entertainment
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit
I flow far from mediocre
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker?
I got my new girl so content
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake
I'll be all in your face, like, ""No speak-a la ingles""
Soon as you hear it, you quote it
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives?
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery
And your ex-man is a hater, officially
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey
I'm outta here, baby
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting?
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke

I got ice all over my windshield
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter
I hit the defrost, I never turn the heat off
And still I'm so chilly willy snowflake
These silly billies really fail to act as if they know Drake
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men
Tellin' my ex-girl tryin' to explain
How I am no good, so go with the next man, but dog
You don't know me, you don't know us
We go by the name of A-T-F, and any previous affiliation
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation
I know you in and out, nigga I am not playin'
Just fall back, keep on Escape'in and Alize'in
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team
Not us, so you knock us, that's precisely what I mean
And dog, it's forever clear, my money evergreen
My presence required in places you have never been
It's all in a day's work, that's what I am on
NBC, MTV, Viacom
And whose Continental GT is outside
Showin' them how monumental he be?
One wheel on the curb, ticket on the dash
It's like every fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass
And maaan I'm a commodity, none of them as hot as me
The industry standard, so I am what they gotta be
Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal
Can't help it, I been brainwashed to kill 'em all
I think I should pass my own amendment
You frontin' with glass all in your pendant
You ain't livin', rapper, you never have been
You a has-been, a gas station attendant
Your man is a turkey, you wit' a liar
I'm clearin' the air, I'm a humidifier
I'm spittin' fire, and gettin' flyer
And what you plannin' for this summer, I did it prior
I've shattered shows in tattered clothes
Met status quos, this is the South
And I am, present when it matters most
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed
I flatter hoes
And drink Dom, they always ask me, ""Is that a rose?""
""You mean Rosé? Why yes it is""
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless
I'm in your house got the key to your home
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known

I don't think they really ready for my wardrobe
I show up right before the store close
And blow the fee from my last four shows
I do one song and use four flows
She used to be a Christian before
Now, all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes
Like, ""Baby, those are cute, I adore those""
Me and the salesman build a rapport so
He understand the fact that I'm spending offshore dough
Cash-only transactions, homie
And please, no receipts—the feds like to explore those
They can't audit if they dont know I bought it
Been doing it for years, homie; thoroughly, I thought it...
Through, what it do? I am currently recording on a track
Admitting most of my currency’s imported
But too late now, it's too legitimate to hit 'em with...
A lawsuit, even if those are acts that I did commit
Repeat offender, Anita Baker playing in the whip
As they pull me over, ""my sweet surrender""
I got a Jewish lawyer as my lead defender
A Menschkeit, as they say; he’s a legal bender
And ATF is present, every regal member
The coalition is so efficient
You have to be invited, or there's no admission
We know tradition, we spend money
So don't try to compete if you in no position
I wish you would listen
I take you back to this trial
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition
My foot is just solely fit for this shoe it fits in
Used to record in the basement that Renny grew his piff in
When Pops turned over keys like a new ignition
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with Pippen
'Til I mention that I wanna play a new position
No team-playing, no screen-setting
""Because I wanna win games, Coach, I'm through assisting""
The takeover, the break's over, nigga
And I'ma keep killing 'em until the day that Drake's over
The wait's over, the tape's coming
They bullshitting, but I am equipped with great plumbing
The human mentality, so eager to hate something
And try to play it off like it ain't jumping
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in
The condo that I just purchased sound vacant
'Cause I have just been sittin' in this cell
Thinking what I could've done to make my first video groundbreaking
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic
Aside from talking 'bout the D I'm throwing in your wife
I treat this one session as if it were my last
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life, like that!You might also like12Embed"

I bet you it's the room, cause I don't do no drugs
Or maybe it's that 'tron cause I sure do have a buzz
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission
So if your ears a virgin I'd advise you not to listen
Cause this shit isn't kosher and this shit isn't Christian
It's that motherfuckin' heat you can find up in the kitchen
Baby holla at your nigga, I got that shit for low
Okay maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know
Wait let me slow it down (down) I'm gettin' ahead (head)
Plus it's gettin' hot so I'm a take a seat instead (stead)
I'm lucky I ain't dead (dead) I'm on a rollercoaster ride y'all
We all of age and I ain't got nothin' to hide y'all
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb

Every record that I've done, the station here they play it
This the city that I run, this the shit that I created
They tellin' me I'm the one and I haven't even made it

They say we lack substance

[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 1: Drake]
They don't be saying how I'm humble, I'm hella nice
Or that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice
They just tell you all the rumors they heard
And we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce
My groove theory is that when you too cheery
They try to bring you down to the level they at
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart, girl
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart, girl
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it
And if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town
I don't know why you sitting on the couch
When you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down
You think taking your purse off
Will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee
And you probably would've been worse off
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I'm back soft
And then I backs off
'Cause you thinking you can predict what happen

But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 2: Phonte]
You probably think I walk around with my gun tucked and
Swang dick to these hoes like nunchucks
Well, you can think what you want but
I think you've been watching too much BET: Uncut
You need to get real and check out my real life
I ain't a tip-drill, don't care what it smell like
But if you feel like putting all your notions aside
And talking to a real nigga, I'd gladly oblige
First name Phonte, I'd be pleased to date ya
College educated, got degrees in papers
But I'm from the South where if you ain't snapping or rapping 'bout trapping, you's a freak of nature
Such an anomaly, speak so well
And talk so collegy, such an astonishing
Contrast to all the bullshit you've been following
On behalf of them, I offer my apologies
Maybe with me you'll unlearn
Putting all niggas in a box of concerns
Me, 'cause I ain't dumb, shit, I'm well-read like sunburn
And after me, you'll never leave no stone unturned
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love

But you don't really know me like you think you know me
We know how you speculate
Thinking we gon' hit your friend if you object to date
Claim we early and be showing up extra late, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

[Verse 3: Elzhi]
Yeah, they say you never judge a book by its cover
Though you appear as materialistic, just like the others
So I followed your words to take 'em in
And I don't see what you saying, so they coming off paper-thin
That's when I felt that I would need to
Do more than just look you up and down
To see if I could read you
And try to get inside your head only
Not just stick my fingers in your middle
To get you to spread for me
So what I learned on my path to discover?
Your story took one ugly turn after another
I saw we wasn't on the same page
I would've gave you strong play
But your words rubbed me the wrong way
So now, I'm closing the case
You only out for the paperback, that's written all over your face
No, El will never judge a book by its cover
Until he seen what was in between and looked at what lies are under
[Chorus: Drake]
Ugh, we know what you're thinking, love
You think we out smoking and drinking, love
Pushing big whips, chains clinking, love
But you don't really know me like you think you know me

Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
Alright so
I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ice so
What is about to unfold
No tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though
I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw
That is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world
Got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch

Take you on a date

Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl? (Yeah)
I can't believe it (I know you got a man)
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
It's all right with me, my girl
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Why you over there looking at me
While your man standing right beside you?
The temporary happiness he might provide you
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like
I don't really wanna hit this girl
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...

[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]
Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some getback for your man mistreating
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair
You'd do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib
And somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing
I'm saying, you need to do what you do
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon
[Chorus: Dwele]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it

[Verse 3: Phonte]
Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patrón
And now, it's been three years off and on
'Cause the same page, we are rarely often on
'Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (C'mon)
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb
But regained it while she was building a house and home
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that she don't know what to do with her life
'Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, it's all good
And I'm in her body like ""Gray's Anatomy""
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (Ugh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, ""Damn, if only her nigga knew,"" but...
(Hahaha, yeah)

And I'm faded off the fluid
I made alot of money
Then I went ahead and blew it
Now I'm trying to make it back
So how the fuck you wanna do it
My nigga you better do it(Aye)...do it
I would say this here's a practice song
And lately I been out in Hollywood
Just acting wrong
What up to Jackie Long
I fuck with Jackie Long
I clown other dudes on the low
I like to laugh alone
I get my cash alone
That's why I shop alone
This here's my uncle's car
I drop it and the top is gone
Your skin looks like you bathe in magnesia and coppertone
And girl I heard your man a fed, don't bring that cop along
I'm running every single light
Ain't one I'm stopping on
This here's a classic jump
That big things are popping on
So baby wipe me down
I sell a watch and swap a home
I'm in this solo
No I do not have a chaperone
I'm in a proper zone
That's right the doctor's home
This here's my time
And I don't even think your clock is on

Check (Nottz, Nottz, Nottz)
They ask me about this rapper chick I might know
I say I never hit it but we sure to try it right though
My verses smother beats and they are in need of some lipo
As for rappers, she is not my type, she's like a typo
Flow is universal, take a blood test, I'm type-O
Nottz do me a favor, turn the volume up, it's quite low
I write so, I might blow, my chain emits a white glow
See life is a scrimmage I am runnin' the ISO
What is about to unfold, no tellin' like a dice throw
Meet a lot of chicks so your girl is someone I might know
It's only if she's nice though, I ain't about the wife though
And let no, Uncle Ben's rice throw, that is just how my life go
And move faster than the leopard sprint
Around the world, got a lot of spots like leopard print
I used to think you play too much
But I'd rather go deaf than lose touch
Holla at me baby

Look, been a minute, I know my number outta service

Now I am gon' give it to you straight out of the bottle
No chaser, I've embraced one in lace, she was a model
Shorty jumped out of the closet even though I mean literal
Her girl made it figurative, or maybe that's what liquor do
Baby, that's the physical, maybe if we spend
A few days all alone on our throne I can get to you
I know you feelin' hittin' on the road is the typical
But I be in the telly, on your Myspace clickin' through

But a fella couldn't Roc, I wanna Dash to my Dame

Damn, I done walked in here
Looking like the motherfucking man of the year
Think I had the motherfucking plan of the year
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers
And I get my girl whatever she desire
And my niggas get whatever they require
These rappers old, I’m the reason they expire
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah
Damn, that punch line was predictable
I still got you shitting bricks, homie quit the bull
And we don’t need new members, to me the clique is full
And I be getting the same women that Tip can pull
Believe or not, I receive a lot
So I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got
And I be buying the Louis that Kanyeezy cop
And I be ripping the same records that Weezy rock
This shit is easy pop
That’s why I’m ready man
I’d never copy Nor-bit like Eddie man
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit
Or was it way over your head, did you forfeit?
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick
Her ass big, she just trying to make a four fit
Yeah, they need to issue out a recall
I’m going up and they heading into a freefall
The fundamentals are needed, you playing streetball
And I was out at BET, but I didn’t see ya’ll
These Skee-Lo rappers wishing they could be tall
Letting all their fake friends use them like a free stall

It start up when I touch the door
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor
As soon as we finish cutting, we can cut some more
Then after you get high
Make em, get em, girl you finna get low
Lights dimmed down
Got a lota dough plus a hit sound
What you mean you ain’t heard? I come highly recommended
Everybody my friend even if they been offended
They ain’t really got a choice, it’s an obvious decision
You tryna make a come up in my city, it’s a given
Plus a nigga famous, plus I got a vision
Not to mention having bars like a motherfucking prison
They taking too long, their records on hold
They threatened by my presence cause I make them feel old
Guaranteed if they drop, they bragging bout what they sold
Just remember where I live at, fifty thousand's going gold
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known
Instead of hatin’ on my music in the comfort of your home
Nigga, be a man, you acting like a bitch
I ain’t acting like I’m rude
I’m just acting like I’m rich, rich

The hustle has become an obsession
I'm on the front line with my weapon
I am the last hope

Can you imagine the last breath of Christ?
The last breath of Christopher Wallace on that faithful night
The last step that Martin Luther took as a man
I got the power of my world in my hand
The Microphone brings life or death in the blink of an eye
I was born to provoke those born to die
I was conceived to beat all odds like Las Vegas
T-dot motherfucker, watch the world rape us
Greatest strugglers hustle to succeed
Cross water smugglers tussle to burn weed
It meets that pressure to success in the South
Niggas watching what I say magnifying my mouth
I never take back talk, I apply the force
Hand blistering from many years of holding the torch
When the skin rebuilds, it grows tougher than leather
So we can keep on hold it forever

Jealousy is something I haven't felt in years
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love
Dawg, I'm incredible fuckin unforgettable, but when it comes to records I will eat it if it's edible
They say the futures always for-seen
That's why I'm steady getting more money more cream
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14
And people get behind and they fight for em' cause he won't let no other niggas write for em'
And even when its quite warm, the attitude coursing through the veins and my city is an ice storm
The name's Drake and I don't take it for granted
I can take it you offended cause I'm taken advantage man

[Chorus: Andreena Mills]
I gotta make it out, or move quickly
Can't allow the past to restrict me

The type of shit that leave your hand stained scarlet
I live it, thought you knew this

Your boyfriends future plans got 'em on todays to-do list
Cause he rollin wit more squares then you would find up on a rubix

I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man
Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I'd like to ummm
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments

[Verse 1:]
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive
But what you expect though
Kinda direct yo
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you
Oops did I let that slip
Oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick

When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing

Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losing a feeling

Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too
Sayin' to my self you deceiving

In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin'
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin'

Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga
How you think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial

So I'mma start this off like you would do it
Uh, shout out to DJ Wristpect
October's Own!
Drizzy, haha
Here I go!
Uh

[Verse]
Look, I stands out
Don't think this ain't some shit that I done planned out
And life is beautiful as ever when it pans out
And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out
But, hah, ask Apple how I get it though
I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never
I don't get bitter, I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled, ""Hey bitches!""
I would never turn around cause I just don't fit the description, hah
But that's just me though
But don't mind him girl, that's just Freako
Please don't cuss girl, that don't suit ya
His name 40 and his name Future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of OVO
I am not doing features now, no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I over-expressing the game
Should I hold back on addressing the lame?
Cause they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm trying to clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And ever since I've been messing with Wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was going nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
And Drake was at the club and he balled like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve
And I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it

And rest in peace to Pimp C life is not a game
Taking over the world no Pinky just a lot of Brain
He bout to send them the shit that I'm on (Yeah)
You probably could have predicted I'm on (Yeah)
My sense of judgment's a officially gone
Up into the air all the smoke from the swisher is blown
Ahh... I'm grown, I'm grown, I'm living in this elevator zone alone
I'm up so high, I'm never coming down and you say you got them hoes but they never coming 'round
I got penthouse bars I stay high above your ass
And I can see it all, my balcony is glass
And wifey's over (Bitches)

And then we do it!

[Verse 1]
Uhh, focus on women then you get less done
It's light work, flow is heavy like a wet sponge
I'm gettin' rich 'cause I think being broke is less fun
Celebratin' Father's day every day so don't get sonned
Where you tryna go, I'm ready
Pick any place in the world, the dough is comin' in steady
I'm chillin' out with T and Jay and Nico
My city ain't a city that support they own people
But I run it, you say something about it, I doubt it
I got this Gucci wallet, I do not leave home without it
I'm 'bout it, I'm 'bout it, I'm standing on these couches sayin'
""Bring this booth a bottle, no we do not need a spout bitch!""
Pardon me, that was rude
If you just started balling I say I'm 'bout to conclude
What more is there to do
And why I would pretend
She call me and I hit it every time like 'SEND' (damn)

Lay her down and fold her like that shit you put a file in
We all get to pitch in and that's when it gets to pilin'
And I'm callin' your bluff
Don't act like you can't see my dialin'
Never embellish, believe 'em 'cause he ain't exist
The stars on my team but I lead the league in asist
Never been a believer that previously exist
I wonder what I be doin' when previously is this
I do breakfast at the Ivy, you can grab some lunch to go
Havin' dinner at Chateau's, right across from Lindsey Loooo-han
Don't I treat you better than your old man?
He couldn't have done it like this sho' nuff

Tone it all down

Good Night and Good Luck by Drake,2008-07-20 00:00:00,(No Album),5,"24 ContributorsGood Night and Good Luck LyricsI guess this is goodbye, Goodnight and Goodluck
I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting them up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting them up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals
Like who told them to mention me?
I am elevated homie, you are elementary
Telling them you selling dope and never sold a Century Sam
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo', converse in one verse
About you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight bi
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
To me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool with it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do with it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' Jeezy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple goodie twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas looking celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the michelin crew
I know a response is something that you itching to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you making out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's making you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinking the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh

It's Drizzy, baby
You already know what it is
It's the first time—I'm high, it's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry, Mama, I had to do it to 'em

O, I see you, homie
I stayed late tonight, right?
You know what happen when I stay late, haha

I swear, it's like this every single time
Toronto, I got you
I got us
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I'm a hard guy to get along with, get on a song with
When shit be going right, well, I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to, the artists I put on with
Don't ever ask for nothing 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth full of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats, I call it ""playing checkers""
I'm never doing verses, I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money, I'll be happy to connect you
Life is better than it's ever been
Scheduling million-dollar meetings with the president
Someone cut the lights on, where is Thomas Edison?
Got a a new condo, watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryna zone, I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers all liars and they women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last-Place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me, ""Just write every single thing you need down""
And he got it for me, and I'm as happy can be now
'Bout to start balling like I'm coming off a rebound
Yeah, and I should have the most bragging rights
Because a nigga spit crack—bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryna get their swagger right
'Cause I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you, pussy-ass hater, you should do you
You ain't heard of me, then you should go and get a Blue's Clue
Oops! I mean a red clue; Wayne's here, suu whoop
Bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't banging, I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF, but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake, I hate to see 'em so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burning like a Camel Light; stupid ho, ash me
But don't ask me shit about me
And know the game really ain't shit without me
She might have to pay me, but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth? Then pull the zipper down and see

Even when I was at school, 'cause bullies aren't bulletproof
Red scarf, hoodie too, probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker, the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything good as you; no, I do everything better
I get paid for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera

And I hate a bony bitch, only like 'em only thick
And I own hip-hop; if you don't spit, I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like ""Drake Drizzy Rogers""
Or ""Drizzy Drake Rogers,"" I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game, I'm too willing to play harder
So harder, I go, there he go
They chant ""MVP"" when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jaz, what it do?
The haters on their face and in their ass is a shoe
Faster than you, badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told you, I get paid by the letter, like:
""A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y""
ZZ Top, yes, he rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a footnote; how long can he could go?
Wondering when he stop? Bitch, when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rocking 'til the sheet rock bend

Two, three, four more, sure, we can handle ya
Gimme e'rythang I want, don't mess my order up
And her ass on point so my homie brought her up
Ma passed me the blunt, then I told her pour it up
In a flash we was gone, and you know I tore it up
Breast, ass, silicone, sex hot as Florida
South Beach, mouthpiece could swallow a Porterhouse
Yup, it get nasty, then I get gully
Grab the coochie, then the Gucci skully
A whole pack of rubbers, then I burned rubber
You cuddle undercovers, tellin' her you love her
When it come to verses, swear that I'm perfect
Murder in the first it's chllin in the hearses
Worthless, singing off key on purpose
We gon' pop, fuck urban (Ooooh)

Say What's Real by Drake,2008-12-06 00:00:00,So Far Gone,4,"118 ContributorsSay What’s Real Lyrics[Verse: Drake]
Why do I feel so alone?
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back, but
It's hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets, showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness, I'm that close
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin' Hov's show, embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus
'Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
'Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear, we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something that these labels can't buy
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, ""Damn, Drake fly""
And he just be like, ""Silly motherfucker, I know
That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em?
He just take them records and he gas up on 'em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em""
Oh, they did, Po, at least they tried to
And that's what happen when you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah, but 40 told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest, coulda fooled me
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand, I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
'Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said, ""'Cause this 'Ye shit, you better kill""
And I think this got this Making-of-a-Legend feel
Problem with these other niggas, they ain't never real

Ah Ha uhh I’m ready, alright J fresh I got 'em

Look, I’m really the heir to the fortune of a millionaire
Talking money with me is really unfair
At the border like, ""I swear, I have nothing to declare
I am nothing like these other niggas coming out this year""
Even if you never met me you can tell I’m on the same shit
Loyal as a mother fucker nobody be saying shit
Dope boys know me cause I often speak they language
So well spoken man I should have went to Cambridge
Y-o-u-n-g ho, women they can be so
Motivated by money that’s why they be on me for
Ask your favorite rapper homie guarantee that he know
If he is the one I’m the zero, (pshh damn)
Please comprehend I am a Surf Club general
I’m Mr. consistent I have never come in intervals
You don’t want be caught in the middle like a center fold
I'm committing suicide if we're ever identical
Click clack pow how you like a nigga now?
In control of my domain
They can do what I allow
And I know Toronto miss me I'mma be home in a minute
That's my city and I run it you just run around in it
They see me out in person and say I ain't heard you sing yet
The world is my playground dont fuck with my swingset
We get the pitching then that's when it gets to piling
I'm calling your bluff don’t act like you can’t see me dialing

But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn, how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
'Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow, they say ""Get it off your chest""
And I'm what all the fuss about
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout
Hit me at the office, same extension

Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave, I always come right back here

A lot of y'all are still soundin' like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shape the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
'Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it

And my stomach was soakin' wet, she only 5'2""
And 40, that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the Phantom's leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do a lot of things hopin' I never have to fit in
So tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak show
And life change for us every single week, so
It's good, but I know this ain't the peak though 'cause I want the:

Or call me Mr. ""Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?""
And fans of the freshman is about to get iffy
While this youngin that you doubted is about to get busy

Damn, whose line is it anyways?
I'm in a daze, you been amazed
Y'all seem to be stuck on that beginner stage
I'm on fire, yup, I've been ablaze
I got dough to blow, but I wanna blow it right, you look nice
And yo' frame makes me wanna bowl a strike, well alright
Guess I might, know what? Fuck it, yes I will
I am more than what you bargained for and nothin' less than real
Put it to your life

It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay

Bun B, king of the trill, also one of the dopest
Whether the streets or on the mic, I'm dope and yes I'm focused
The gangsta recognize me for my loc-ness, no joke, it's
Time to shake these haters off like the skin of a locust
Or maybe like a python, that's the type of shit I'm on
I wrote this on my iPhone, so let me drop this iBomb
I palm the game like it's a Spalding ball and take flight
From the free-throw line and slam it down like I'm the great Mike
Bun and Wayne and Drake in here, mane, this gon be a great night
Look at all these posers bite our swagger like a great white
Try to cross me over I just fake left, then I break right
Stupid animal tricks like David Letterman's Late Night
This that major moment you've been waitin' on for too long
The best that ever did it and doin' it on a new song
UGK and Young Money, too strong
Bound to be in the green like a crouton, so what the fuck is you on?

'Cause I got that swag boy, the swag you never had boy
Hate and I will leave your chest the color of my flag, boy

'Cause you don't know who I was before you
And basically, to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah

But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff 'cause you're my baby
I love you, love you, a little bit

As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressure's on, both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well, tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin' on her ass

Yeah, I appreciate your patience tonight
It's been a moment since I've done some public speaking
I find nowadays it's, you know, best to keep quiet
But, uh, sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion, you know what it is

[Verse 1: Drake]
Uh, look, I'm the property of October
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes, rosé and some shots over
I think better when I'm not sober
I smoke goodie, no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder
Private flights back home, no stop over
Still spittin' that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm the Group of Seven
A migraine, take two Excedrin
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven
And if I die I'ma do it reppin', I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein' me all hard
And lyin' to they girls and drivin' the same cars
Sittin' there wishin' their problems became ours
‘Cause we have nothin' in common since I done became star
I done became bigger, swervin', writin' in my peers' lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name
One touch, I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out, baby, word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriend's waking-up ringer
Heh, or alarm, or whatever
She be here at six in the morn' if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
'Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin' the shows gettin' everyone nervous
'Cause them hipsters gon' have to get along with them hood niggas
It's all good, I'm goin' off like lights when the show's over
Make pasta, rent a movie, call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger, but I'm no joker
I'll slow roast ya, got no holster
Wet glass on your table, nigga; no coaster
Burn bread everyday, boy; no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG, but I'm no smoker
They just handin' chips to me, nigga; no poker
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit

One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already, I'm feeling throwed in this bitch

[Verse 1]
Up so high even when I'm coming down
Just met a girl, say she from the H-Town
I say my name is Drizzy and ain't nobody realer
Cup inside a cup, smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy, nigga I'm, the man
I sent ya girl a message, said I'll see ya when I can
She sent me one back, but I ain't never read it
'Cause pussy's only pussy and I get it when I need it

And I'm telling you, I'm as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner

Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the D's

It's fuckin' losers like you that make me do what I do
Make me hate where I'm from, you as fake as they come
Everybody got guns, who the fuck gonna squeeze
Everybody got songs, but you ain't fucking with these
Why you wish to be ghetto, tell me what's it about
While you're tryna get in we're all tryna get out
Why don't you just be yourself, why don't you tell us the truth
Like how you only load guns when you up in the booth
You ain't nothin' to shoot, you don't even exist
You're just a fantasy family as weak as it gets
And you ain't speakin' to Bish, cause I don't listen to chicks
I don't argue with broads, cause I'm really a pimp
But I will tell you this, as far as y'all are concerned
Pull out my Santa Claus, and make the holidays burn
You can call me the Grinch, cause y'all are nothing but Who's
Just another bunch of low life's with nothing to do

[Verse 2: Ken Masters]
Now let the kids play like the rider's ride
We spendin' all day, these niggas idolize
They claim they want fame nigga so we decided
That we gon' make 'em some stars until the drama dies
But they can go back to they holes where they mama lies
Or write more lies about they drugs, guns or homicide
Funny, claim the thug life that they abidin' by
But run up on 'em, then they turn into the silent type, they wanna compromise
My niggas, we ride or die
And roll with them bitches that got they body right
These niggas ain't built, ain't got the body type
Time to break a nigga's spirit like the Amistad, tryna fool the audience
Feel the ambience
Stars in your presence, kings of the city are appalled by the peasants
Ain't gotta say names, we can all get a reference
Brains and the info from your broads in the west end
Masters, flowing staggers on bars
Nigga stay mad cause his swagger's on Mars

Claim you want war, okay, on guard

When you in the booth, tell me why you have to lie
Come on, spit the truth, all I hear is bang bang, hustle this, hustle that
But if you hustle crack, then where the money at?
No proof, Dr. Seuss, story tellin' when he rhyme, like
Once upon a time I was really on the grind
There's another lie, couldn't out-hustle me
Hatin' when it come to D, I can take you're starting 5
I'm only goin' at generic rap niggas that
Rap about ki's but couldn't show me 10 G's
And these nigga' dry snitching on they tees
Standing out, like a sore thumb to the D's
My nigga please, if you really had work
You would do what you do and wouldn't put it on your shirt
It makes my heart hurt when dumb niggas act hood
You ain't no hustla, just a nigga that can rap good

[Verse 4: Jonny Roxx]
See there's a height requirement, nigga to mention my name (smarten up)
How the fuck you little niggas didn't stay in your lane
Man you offered me a truce and I took it
Now I hear this bullshit so how the fuck am I to overlook it?
If this little nigga survive then it gotta be God
How the fuck are you a hustla with your factory job ?
And I don't get it, nigga I'm a fucking diabetic
And I don't usually eat y'all sweet niggas
Every time I see y'all retard niggas y'all bitch out
Waddup Roxx? now we cool? then you dip out
Talkin' all that bang bang shit, pull a clip out
Sayin' you a blood, next week you prolly crip out
I'm saying, we don't believe y'all niggas (nah)
G-35, x5 nah niggas (yeah)
This here is a public announcement for my niggas (yeah)
No more goodnight, good mornin', goodbye niggas
[Verse 5: JD Era]
I don't appreciate niggas sayin' my name in they bullshit
It's like putting a knife against the lyrical full-clip
Do shit on my own, I never asked for help
If I was rapping like y'all I woulda killed myself
And nah, this ain't beef, it's missing a few ingredients
Dog you ain't a general, stick to being obedient
Piggy back, that ain't something I had to do
Laughing at Drake? you should'a seen how I was laughing at you
I don't beef over little shit, angry? A little bit
Little niggas get little recognition you little bitch
I don't do the little subliminals, I'm addressin' it
And if Littles wanna get in the middle then I'm suggesting it
They called you a bitch, were tryna act out
They challenge 'em to a fight and then they back out
So tell me how the fuck I can respect you cats
If you a gangsta, then what part of the game is that?

[Verse 6: Drake]
Hey yo Aristo, I'm lost, can you tell me whats goin' on in the streets?
How it feel to count dough while you palmin' the heat?
And yes I asked for a 16, you did your 16
I heard that weak shit and only wanted the beat (it's true)
But fuck the money and the cars that I drive to set
And fuck the women that's lying to all the guys they met
And fuck the features on my songs and the deals on the table
Or basically it's fuck everything that you strive to get
And it's the room of resolution, I'm finishing it in here
If I copy Budden's flow, you mimickin' his career
And the same money we hearin' you giving to charity
You need to be giving to Littles to give him some clarity (what up Littles)
'Cause that's your homeboy I think he's owed that much
Tell him pressing 25 don't mean you sold that much
And Breana, I don't mean to alarm ya
But you need to get outside the car to shoot this video in Parma (Tony!)
You act like you hood and hood niggas'll harm ya
And this is not hatin' my nigga we call it karma
But yo Thug Life, show me where the hammer be
Yes I took an L on my own and they didn't damage me
You try to cover up your lies like a canopy
And tryna pull 17 year olds down in Bramalea (I know about it)
And we don't got it out for you
We just saying that don't nobody vouch for you
Nope, nobody thorough is willing to give a cosign (nobody)
And you don't even sell blow, you just blow time
You can't even get a factor grant
So stop rapping, go fix parts at a tractor plant (damn)
And listen here, Tetley Tea
You one of the seven dwarfs standing next to me
You probably snitchin' in court, then accept the plea
And I hear you paying these women and I sex for free (what up sweetheart)
But dog, how did this start, how we get to this part?
We all got niggas doing bids ""Mr. Wishheart"" (what up Cam)
It's not cool to use another nigga's as a threat tho'
I said you a bitch, I heard a seven man echo
You saying I hustle, my source for currency coke
They saying you never moving it and currently broke
And you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime
Just so you can have something to say in you rap lines
They say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school (I did)
Dog if I were you, I tell you what I would do
I would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you
Lose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through
Tell them not to call and that's even if they require you
'Cause they the only people recording that wanna hire you (it's true)
With what I spend in a weekend I could acquire you
Some of them believe you got money you little liar you
But, I don't admire you, short niggas tell tall tales

I'm on that old, switch lanes shit, Jay, Big, Dame's shit
Talking 'bout them niggas that my daddy pitch cane wit
Because I never learned the biz, I learned the language
Well-spoken, man I should've went to Cambridge
And mama would always claim this
I never expected the outcome, but one day I became this
Famous, no longer nameless
More game, but I'm the same, I will remain this
I'm still focused, I stay grounded
You see I ran with a style when they clowned it
So read 48 Laws if you never read it
Because that is one of the main reasons I'm level-headed
Despite the accumulated success
If my attitude ever strayed, I made it regress
I never wanted to win the lottery only because my uncle
Told me ""He who made it by struggling made it the best""
So with that on my chest, I'm down on my last 12 gs
Going through the closet thinking I should prolly sell these
Chanel Cs, and LVs, somebody stop before I really start to rebel please
I spend it all, who needs anymore?
Whose satisfied doin' good deeds anymore?
Who grieves anymore, who believes anymore?
Who graduated school and still reads anymore?
Not me, that should have my whole race shook
Because we don't read novels but we do FaceBook
The new craze is havin' that new age look
If I said I liked it, I'd feel like a two-faced crook

Make sure you don't fall in love, cause I don't have the time for that
Only thing I chase is money, if you tell me where it's at

Uh, yeah man, uh
I feel real good right about now
I feel like im, im making a return
I ain't even been gone yet I ain't even
Taken a leave of absence but I feel like I'm back
Yeah man

[Verse]

Check, I roll with the coalition, when no one listened
I spoke out now niggas is throwing this in
You gassed up, my vehicle low emission
I can enter your field trip with no permission
Slip, i've done it before told ya I run it before
Now the city is mine, and what you thought it would be
Ain't a rapper working harder than me I put my heart in T
Uh, ?, carry the city on my back like a Jansport
Or even in a victor bag, so if you quick to brag then u get clipped to tag
Homie, u make a lot of music niggas ain't feeling
You rappers shouldn't rap, you rappers should paint ceilings
That's why I ain't competitive y'all, cuz deep down I know im much better than y'all
Watchu mean do I actually flow, wanna know if I actually flow just ask V-O
Im tryna make the wrist on my cousin ashley glow till she waken up by someone and it actually snow
Stop snitching if your man seen a killer, you never ever seen it, it can't seem familiar
We keep it on and poppin like the dance scene in Thriller
This the new version fresh prince and andreana miller
And d-10tion the boi-1da
And people focused on keeping the boy under
Probably cuz I don't act like y'all
And I ain't gotta sell crack like y'all
Well not really, I mean I do move crack in a disc form
But thats only because I don't rap like y'all
And now its occurring to them
Its starting to be my friend is reassuring to them
Either that or every verse im referring to them
So catch me in a zone till they leave me alone
Uh, yea, and its down south for the summer ima leave them at home

And my split's all good
And these haters pretending
That it's all good
Say that shit in person
Man I wish ya'll would
I'm a mothafucking genius goddammit
I ain't the type to murder you
I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat
If you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket
And these rappers in a panic
But Belly told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me
Would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
And tell my city I'm the two-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
No bench time, nickname started Drake
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break

They say we killin' 'em all, all, all, all

[Verse 1: Drake]
Hip hop's newest and youngest acquisition
If this was you, I wonder what you'd do in that position
Try to make a profit or try to make a difference
Try to make 'em play your shit or try to make 'em listen
I go from records with Dwele and L.B. and Elzhi
The meetings where they tell me to start making records and that They'll buy
Now I'm out in A-Town
They tellin' me Trey sound
It's too mainstream if I plan on me stickin' around
But the allure of this year's Scream Tour has been cuttin' all them Jawns that be hurtin' the game
I be dreamin' 'bout hoes and doin' them live shows
Shirtless, that's why I started to personal train
Dog, personally mane
I'm a person that came to bring purpose to a seem unless they purposeless game
It never feel like it's earned when you purchase the fame
Now my thoughts gettin' deeper and I'm searchin' the game
I keep on, on, on, on, on

See where we from, the 50's are bloody
And the 100 dollar bill is dirty brown, they love me
I mess up my livin' room, and studio with my money

And yeah we get our dumb on like San Frisco Bay
With 40 and Mac Dre

[Verse 3: Drake]
Look, uh
I used to get 'em like murda murda
Ol' time killin'
I wasn't even rappin', spent my whole time chillin'
And now the girls like
It's only Drake got chased and so the artists I respected try and Take my place
But pimpin' ain't easy man and neither is rappin'
They one in the same when you need it to happen
My city full of players they just needed a captain
In need of him right now in need of him back then
But back then I was actin'
Nowadays I serve backhands with backspin
Tryin' to prove rappers are intelligent black men
And  now whoever chose to back out is back in
They say there's two sides to every story and three when the truth Get told
So grab a spoon 'fore your soup get cold
When you drive it off the lot is when your coupe get old
So please discover an answer 'fore proof gets sold
And keep on, on, on, on, on

And every time I touch it guaranteed to be hit
And when them checks come guaranteed to be a split

But I'm here now these niggas is old news
I mix cocaine powder with the pro tools
(Whip it) Yeah crack that's just how I double back
Europeako jeans bleeding on them white air max
And these niggas keep asking me when you gon' drop
Why the fuck you keep harassing me when's that gon' stop

And they sayin' damn I use to know the boy

And the little kids wanna be him

And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture
With four walls
Give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired

My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though
Important and vital
I'm caught in a cycle
And this is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain
And my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king
Nigga it's the same thing
All day long
But that's the screw face
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not
Play me
I'll never go broke
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan
I am a passionate man
Planted with cash in my hand uhh

Look... I got few days left
And I'm a make use of every single one
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold
And till every string is strung
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come
Dog... it's always been the same
It's all love
Like no score in a tennis game
For the son of Dennis James
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up
They will close down richmond
With no down shiftin'
Haters will say I'm adequate
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts
So I put my 2 cents in
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together
For they buy us out
They profit from the event
We handin' fliers out
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out
But rich is how we're all endin' up

Pay me in advance and make sure that it’s exact
My ex girl’ll probably show up for the simple fact
That tomorrow she can tell all of her friends it was whack
But fuck that though, this about me
They say my whole fan base is missing ID
But the young trendsetting musician I be
Got critics giving up the recognition I de-serve
Never bring your Mrs by me
I’m it I’m it call me Mr. IT
If I get one wish I'ma wish to die free
They say gon head, ball like Ms. Arie and I do
The realest in my age group, no shit
SoHo, Cosmo, Balmain blow fish
Let's make a toast, tell your friends come closer
Drinks on me like a coaster

[Chorus]
We doing it big
Look at what I done
Look at where I’m is

When they was having fun
So please don’t be surprised when they announce that I won

When I was up in Hot Beats in Atlanta steady giving daps
Fetching niggas drinks but I never got to rap
If anybody asked though I prolly woulda snapped
But I can’t sign nothing 'til my lawyer get the facts and
No one decides who the definition of talent is
And Mrs. Murray look at what my talent did
And what your business is
It's been a couple years
Guess it’s not about who you know
It’s just how you balance it
It’s always awkward to dummy a nigga artist
And get on someone song when you know you coming the hardest
It's how you start actin' when nobody can reach you
My plan just hatched, happy easter

Problem is they be telling everybody but me
But I always got a Starbucks verse
Being brewed too hot please please double cup me

And I never trust a nigga saying trust me
Nick cannon and will never did it this ill
So you tell the house band don’t you dare interrupt me
Thanks to my mother for never giving up
You deserve the world, now gon' live it up
Thanks to Uncle Steve, my hero who always saved us
I could never give back everything you gave us

And to my dad even though we was apart
I couldn’t leave you out, you forever in my heart

Got a new chick, booty round like the merry go

Straight nigga tryna get in through a crooked door
Barely fittin in cuz a gimmicks what they took him for
But getting doubted caused me to reroute it
To another destination where the people they abouuut ittt!
You ever felt high above it all?
Run your fingers through the clouds like the sky about to fall?
Treat me like I'm rich when I'm about ball
And think once about the clothing that I buy up out the Mall

Dope like coke lines and crack like broke glass

Fear by Drake,2009-09-15 00:00:00,So Far Gone (EP),2,"121 ContributorsFear Lyrics[Intro]
This is why I do this shit
I think they call this ""venting""

[Verse 1]
Look, this is me, still the same
They want the hits, I play the game
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain
It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein
What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville?
I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still
The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil
Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal
That ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes
And I been getting high just to balance out the lows
And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows
But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised
And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive
So every word I utter will be mine

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)
I never cried when Pac died
But I probably will when Hov does
And if my tears hold value then I would drop one
For every single thing he showed us
And I'll be standing in a puddle
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble
And I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle
It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle
Staring at the members of my team
Who get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme
Just know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams
I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems
But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless
And know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions
At least I put it all in the open

[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me

[Verse 3]
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year
Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here
I should be on top of the world just chilling here
Uh, but it's funny having fans
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance
And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game
And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same
Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home
People think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere
So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone
I think I'm scared of what the future holds
I was wishing for some things and now I'm used to those
Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed
All my old friends think I got a new crowd
And people seem to notice every time I do smile
I guess that mean they come few and far between
Even though I'm living out what you would call the dream
Yeah, and my uncle ain't even messaging me
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me
I hope this isn't one of those forever things
It's funny how money can change everything
[Chorus]
Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes
Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me
I remember you, this feeling isn't new
So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me40Embed"

Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle

She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out

Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high

Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot

Feeling sorry for the runner up
I’m still awake, getting money while the sun is up
And they keep saying how they need me to deliver
Cause they hate it when the rookie star doesn’t put the numbers up
Man, hate is so passé, catch me in a Tom Ford suit on draft day
Nigga and it’s just me and my money
Ya don’t even get to play when ya’ll leading by 20
Yeah I infiltrated the game
I was hesitant at first and fear what it would change
Now I’m high off the success and faded off of the fame
And still managed to keep all of my opinions the same
I am so far gone bitch I'm outta here
Hotter than standing inside rocking outerwear
I want it all man, I never learned how to share
I also can no longer converse with you thousandaires
Wow, I swear I'm killing shit I'm killing shit

Yeah from the beginning to the end

Still...

Whipping the chevy, still getting my tipped licked
When I'm ready I still fall off intheparty like confetti
It's still mad rappers, D. Dot Angelettis
Still just as skinny as you met me
Still keep it real, never will let another disrespect me
For real, til deep in peace they rest me
Still smoke cess cause I swear that they stress me
And when I'm home a lot, keep the chrome a lot
Cause even when I'm home I'm knowin' there ain't a lot of dudes
That don't like the fact I'm blowin'
Like some running shoes on the track I'm goin'
Tell these other dudes they slack I'm sewin'
Don't get hemmed up, I think Timmed up
Cause in my mind it's the winter time all the time
I'm a grind
Tell em I'm a rhyme, told em that this sing got me signed
Try to put me in a box I will not stay there
And if I fall I will not lay there
Grown man, this is not daycare
A big boy game, they do not play fair
But I still keep it trill and I got this chair
Still uncomfortable if cops is there
My fam still dysfunctional, we not repaired
Still got rhymes out the asshole
Still wonder why are they mad for
Cause I'm in the hood like the crack-ho diesel
Ask yo people, Trey still do it for the people
Ride with some inter straps your whole fucking car is illegal
Still pick good over evil
Still play the Jesus and it's wild cause I'm still sinning
Addiction still weed-puffin, giving it to women
It's still my brain ready to bust up out my skull
To the mic, cause my mouth to be saying shit right
They saying shit like, I don't be killing it
You niggas is ridiculous, eat a dick or some syphilis
Die slow, still I done sucked it up

Never got the chance to put you back in a condo

I left the cars at the house and I put the diamonds down
Them things come and they go its about the rhyming now
Im seeing it clearer the season is nearer
And still I must change
Im like a broken bill
Conservative for the most but I'm outspoken still
They not sure of the work but they all hoping he'll
Emerge to victor my words are pictures
And guess the colours so loud that you heard my scripture
With 4 walls give me the right brush and I draw all
I promise I've been thinking before y'all
I barely get tired I'm rarely inspired
And you accomplish in a week what I'm daily required
I meet quotas while you rappers having sleep-overs
Spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova
Be in the throne instead of being your own
But Look

[Verse 2]
I'm making moves in my city so
My ex girls wanna be up in the video
They ex girls is steady tryin to get with me though
Important and vital I'm caught in a cycle
This is all I know
And yes I know it well
I try to explain it, my effort comes to no avail
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells
And still they claim king nigga its the same thing
All day long
But thats a screw face
Rappers befriend you at first but really they two faced
Hoping they slip and trip over your own shoelace
Thats why I tuck em in not giving a fuck again

Think I got the type of flow that would make an addict quit

Repurchased trap music 4 times since then
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince
Getting pennies for my thoughts
So I put my two cents in
Top of the morning I am dropping the coin in
Plus I'm changing the game
You hear me swapping the joint in
They put the fires out and bring the buyers out
And try and box us all together before they buy us out

Then we profit from the attempts to hand desires out

Chillin' even if I'm in a goose down coat
I can't see you through the Mosley Tribes
So I don't even flinch if you throw me high-fives
They try to measure up, but there is no one my size
Whatever 40's smokin' 'bout to low my eyes
Beast mode on them, I never take a night off
Every single thing a nigga purchase is a write off
Grounded as the runway pavement, I'm taking flight off
Baby go ahead and cut the light off
Cause it's about to go

[Verse 2]
I hear my phone ringing when you call
I ain't pickin' up or entertainin' them at all
Got your girl face down, bangin' on the wall
While you and all your homeboys hang in Lenox Mall
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I cannot relate
Ridin' with some tags that I got from out of state
Ridin' with a swag that I got from outer space
Just show me who's the hottest, I'mma knock him out his place
Call me homicide Drizzy, I'm 'bout to kill your ego
I'm about my green, puffin' goody like I'm Cee-lo
You can go and take a glance at your hero
While the Houston ship a pole dancing zero
Fantasy to you, reality to me
And yeah, my G-pass is as valid as can be
I'm so fresh, a stylist would agree

No ice on, big Phantom no license
Fuck if you're feelin me as long as your wife is
No one in my city gotta pocket like Drizzy
I can rock fitted Jeans cause my credit card skinny
It's pitch black and covers all incidentials
And Ms. Rhone sorry you ain't notice my potential
Fuck ya rappers and your self-proclaimed status

Cos I'm tryna fuck Megan Fox this year
And if you got a stylist to cop you gear
And you are in my age bracket, you are not my peer
Fuck you really know about a Eames couch
Frette sheets, perfect touch to a clean house
Wide awake, but a nigga's livin' ya dreams out
Lookin like a photoshoot everytime the team's out
And is the realest nigga still I

She always run back to me saying he's a dog
Off the leash, he got this other girl Alicia
She tell me she's in hell, I tell her, ""Take a breather""
I'm nothing like your man, but I can't love you neither
It's wifey over bitches, but money's over her
'Cause money's under nothing, my life is such a blur
It's not the way it has to go, it's just what I prefer

Responsible for everything you listen to, a mediocre talent, let me see if I can condition you
Took over my city, and I never asked permission to
Started poppin' bottles, cause it's ATL tradition to
Celebrate with Bob Ma, fuck him at the So-ho
If there ain't an elevator in it, it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin', and these bitches wanna snow blow
And they just give me head, while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ should've won that
Listen and respect, man, the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, halla at me when you're done laps
Roll around with Neego, Party with Azooka
Shout goes out to 1Da, shout goes out to Future
Shout goes out to Getti, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch, just can't seem to hold it steady
'Cause I see the flame flickering, x girls bickering
Got these women jockin' me from Holly Grove all the way to Picker Ring
I tryed to send my nigga Short some syrup out in Michigan, but my connect said it'd take a minute if you listening
Please start doing you, I been doing me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody, even if you suin' me
My brother P-rain know, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot an officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hopin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just halla if you got me, fuck you if you had me
Shout goes out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver, and 40, man, you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to B Plus
The names I mention are crucial, you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine

I put my whole city on to some things
That they never would've known if I didn't stunt hard
And every night is a premiere (yeah)
If I ever disappear (look), best believe I'm comin' back, stunt hard
Got rich, went broke, and got rich again (yeah)
On that same shit again (alright), all I ever do is stunt hard

[Verse 1: Drake]
I tell her, I'm getting motherfuckin' busy
So many spins my records is motherfuckin' dizzy
Haters wanna turn to their girl and be like, ""Who is he?""
But I bet a million she tell you that's motherfuckin' Drizzy
And I'm focused on my survival
Keep an eye on the door and focus on my arrival
Who do you look up to when you're better than your idols?
And how you 'posed to look when you do it with your eyes closed
I'm everything you just haven't become
I spend my time trying to outdo what hasn't been done
Now hopefully live to see what they say that I'm gon' be
And if not I hope future does in the memory of me
Get your team in order, assembly is key
And all my niggas shut up at the mention of a plea
They rather be apprehended and keep quiet than to be
On the stand jeopardizing an inch of their loyalty
Pick a lane, pick a lane, that's all I ever heard
But I'm just trying to swerve, without hitting the curb
That's why I spend thousands on bottles so I can pop them
And take photos with hater niggas and crop them
I am not them, I photoshop them out
'Cause they don't understand what I'm 'bout

Sittin' this tall, I float high, goodbye, I will miss y'all

Just to get that belt to fasten
All she wanna talk about is partying and fashion
Don't know where she going
But I do not plan on asking at all
Cause her spirit is free
And she, lets nobody else in except for me
If her basement is locked, then I swear she would agree
I’m the only one she loves
There’s no copies of the key
Homie, that’s a guarantee

[Verse 2]
Don’t forget that Fendi purse that you put all your cash in
Kinda hard to concentrate when cameras are flashin’
Other dudes would suffocate her, I don’t want her gaspin’
Don’t know where she’s going
And I do not plan on asking at all
I’ve never been the type, felt alike

Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's

Nope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo

Have a hard time looking
I tell you second hand that's a hard grind cooking
Cause my pop was in it so deep
If his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage
Instead, I drop bars like I'm two months sober
Its my time now so them you months over

Yeah if I want it I find me a way to get that
I'm trying to get to the point where I can sit back
Took a lot of patience and action
I grind so I'm anticipating relaxing
I'm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts
I don't need brothers fillin' space in the back than
So from the kid with the sun tan flow
The hottest ticket in town to this one man show

I can easily make'em admit to bounce back
Without knowing exactly where my accounts at
Yeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve
So they don't like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me
I can't lie sometime it bother me slightly

Either way the true fans yell
I appear calm and its obvious so who can tell
And no this ain't Blu Cantrell
This is like perfection though we both got the light complexion
Couple things that I do that well
And the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L [As in Samuel Jackson]

They stay kicking it with me like a field goal
See I'm humble but I live vain
With more deals on the table than a bridge game

I said, ""Tell me what's really goin' on""
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'

When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe

Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group

But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em

But later doesn't always come so instead
It's uh-okay, you could thank me now
Uhh, yeah
Well, alright
Here I go

[Verse 1]
Uh, Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well, that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of ""influential,"" I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party, Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
Who'd have thought the route we'd chosen
Would ever end up this scenic?
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And that's around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to A.I. him for your survival
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us, yeah
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted, y-you can thank me now
And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
'Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up, 'cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
Yeah, that's how you know it's going down
In case another chance never comes around

[Verse 2]
Uh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me, I'll miss it
'Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
Man, the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins?
Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at ""Hello""
Because of what they allowed, where are they all now?
I know they're somewhere watching
So I'm trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?
They say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key
That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it–
I'm sorry
Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while I'm still here in this position
[Chorus]
Y-you could thank me now (Thank me now), uh, go 'head (Go 'head)

And if you dolled up, I got the voodoo for you bitches, yeah
I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy: stunt double
Fame is like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip, just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does, ahh

That if you were a star, you'd be the one I'm searching for
Other girls they, they got attention
But I just always feel like they're in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that you're a student working weekends in the city
Tryna take you out girl, hope you're not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
For you to get ready to, put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what you're doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
Like somebody's taking pictures

Show me a good time (Aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now, uh

Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do if they could
It's in our nature, ahh—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground, though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because any way you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!
[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about

9AM in Dallas by Drake,2010-06-15 00:00:00,Thank Me Later,7,"120 Contributors9AM in Dallas Lyrics[Verse]
These are my One St. Thomas flows
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go
Discussing life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds glow
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays
I just came off making two million in 30 days
Damn, ""I guess it does"" is what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up?
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen
But still throwing touchdown passes
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of Essence

Comin from my spot and I dont signal as I back in
If cash is beautiful, then money is attraction
Then I should be a motherfuckin’ centerfold of Maxim
Open to my page and admire my desire
Frequent flyer, I aspire to retire
My voice stands alone even if I’m with the choir
Got a cannon on my hip, but nigga, this is not Mariah
Na, this the record killer for hire
I sleep and eat with the weapon, the beat is all I require
Look I created, despite the niggas that hated
Every single bar gettin' first forty-eighted
In the state of euphoria feelin' so sedated
The me and bitch the same, we feel so related
Forest Hill estated, all dinners catered
I put a thousand on it, I could probably fuck the waitress
So, wait, just take this
Oone lie at a time, make sure it makes sense
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit
Drop a four in it and then appreciate The Greatness, nigga

[Verse 2]
I wrote this verse sittin' in my new car
Sometimes where you headed is too far
It’s more about where you are
And I am, everywhere where that you wish you could be
Somebody, somewhere just really understood me
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope
My other niggas move keys, no off notes
But understand rich is how we're all ending up

To do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go
Whether that's right, I will never know, oh-oh-oh

Tried to be patient but waited too long
But I would've came back, but I would've came back for you

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned
Bitches, what's up with ya?
I hate calling the women ""bitches,"" but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I'm urging all daughters to kiss their mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls counting on me to be there like missing rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I've been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won't remember?
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feeling like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be aging shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engaging shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I've been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don't really fuck with, fuck is up?
Having lunch and debating Ferrari prices
23 and going through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I'm not saying I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I'll never forget none of that

This smoke is getting blown, and these drinks are super strong
I know they ain't getting money like we do
So it’s on
I was looking for the one

Now I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it
And I’mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don’t even know me
I’mma do it all

That's probably why I’m back up in this bitch
Going harder than I did
Watch me do it

Tonight I’m into breaking up
Somebody’s home
I’m drunk as ever
I’m not alone
I-I-I-I’m with my people
I know you love it
I don’t just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
It's just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair and pinot grigio
Baby, forget about it
I'm headed wherever this motherfucking jet is routed
You can’t have my heart the doctor told me I’d be dead without it
My judgment's never cloudy
That’s why I’m steady yelling weatherman, weatherman
I’m about whatever man
I’m tryna fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland

Broke just doesn’t suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where’d I put my bow tie
Millionaire, multi
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I’m the man now, I guess that part's a given
So someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask what's up and they just always say the cost of living
I learn from it though, I’ve been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love I don't think should happen
'Cause everything's easier to get into than get out of
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Because the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I’m still the mafia, I still run the committee

I feel good I got some time off, Girl its been so long
Did you have fun? ’cause Ima need a cab just to get me home
And maybe you can call in sick
And bring you to the crib and get all this, all this
I know, I know I’m blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

Probably one of my realest loves ever
Four page letters, and time is all better
‘Cause time heal whatever
Ima need a moment ’cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, Females are on a regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friend with benefits till we ready
Now ready, Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like “one more chance”, more problems no biggie ah
It’s all good don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give eachother space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that (all that)
Tell your friends they can fall back

Two things I don't give a bitch: pay checks and sympathy

All around paid, can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart, sentence me

And if you ever feel the need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we living separate lives
Trying to tell you, less feelings mean less goodbyes
That's some game for your ass, better recognize
But some cats can't even relate

It's sitting at the house like I bought it in '96
'Cause honestly I'm too fucking busy to drive stick, I swear
Too fucking busy, too busy fuckin'

And some charges, how the fuck can I get her to Paris?

Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame

Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry

I'm still pullin' out the phantom and these haters can't stand him

I'm still shuttin' cities down every time I come around
Nigga I'm still doin' my thing

[Verse]
Responsible for everything you listen to
While mediocre talent proceeds to try and condition you
Took over my city and I never asked permission to;
Started poppin' bottles cuz it's ATL tradtion to
Celebrate at Bymark, fuck 'em at the SoHo
If there ain't a elevator in it it's a no go
Coldest thing droppin' and these bitches want a snow blow
And they just give me head while the haters give me promo
And man, my DJ shoulda won that
Nelissa and Wristpect, Man the city owe us one back
All these old heads keep they minds on one track
And me, I run Toronto, holla at me when you done laps
Roll around with Niko, party with Azuka
Shout goes out to 1da, shout goes out to future
Shout goes out to Getty, motherfucker I am ready
And whoever got the torch just can't seem to hold it steady
Cuz I see the flame flickerin', ex-girls bickerin'
Got these women jockin' me from Heart Lake Road to Pickerin
Tried to send my nigga short some syrup out in Michigan
But my connect said it'd take a minute if you're listenin'
Please start doin' you, I been doin' me
And I'm a staple in my city, you can never ruin me
Rappers are emotional, critics be reviewin' me
But I got love for everybody even if you're suin' me
My brother P-Reign knows, we fuck with the same hoes
Plus he taught me how to spot a officer in plain clothes
Starin' at you pussy niggas, all I see is rainbows
Hoppin' on a jet to every single Lil Wayne show
Me and Lil Jazzy, please do not harass me
Just holla if you got me and fuck you if you had me
Shout out to Brian E, shout out to Photo Will
Shout out to Oliver and 40, man you know the deal
Shout out to Mayhem, shout out to P-Plus
The names I mention are crucial; you gonna need us
And life is good, everything is just fine
I am so sure of my rhymes
I could sacrifice a line like (mumbles)

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)

It's nothing personal
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up
With ""I swear, you don't know this city anymore
They might have loved you before
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you""
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year

No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run
When all is said and done, more is always said than done
And I was told once, things will change
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names
Rochelle, Jordan
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth?
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth?
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it
Yeah, just lie to my ears
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas

But I'd never break the promises I made to myself
And I would never make up names for myself

'Cause I thought it was all I needed
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit

Couple things due, but you always get it done
Might've been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go
Can't you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wonderin' what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these motherfuckers wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is

B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddling
And my shit's so wet, you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row your boat
It's Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too
Apparel, I'm dominatin' every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
'Cause I'm fl-fl-fly, I'm flyin' high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
Could be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sag'
I'm a star, sheriff badge
What's the point if I'm guardin'?
Double-D up, hoes, Dolly Parton

I know things get hard, but girl, you got it, girl, you got it, there you go

Yeah

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but I'm the truth, that's right, I fuckin' said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'
Rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, ""Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga,"" ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
You might also like[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm livin'
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga

And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (Huh)
And I know the sun will rise with me (All we wanted was an opportunity)
Just Blaze (Lord knows)

[Verse 1: Drake & Rick Ross]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas, they want no problems
Bought 'em sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody won't make it a thing
I'm more concerned with niggas thinkin' 'bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields, they makin' the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real (Woo)
Places they say they've been, we actually goin' for real (Woo)
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rappin' (Woo)
I'm going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things (Huh)
With my new bitch that's livin' in Palm Springs
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin' fun at
Never the flow, though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendant of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out 'cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson, boost the rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch, all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real

The hustle's an art, I painted what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica (Woo)
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival Cruise
And these niggas talkin' like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss (Huh), came to buy the bar (Huh)
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car (Woo)
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double-R (Woo)
Headlights flickin', lookin' like a falling star

[Verse 1: Drake]
Never thoughts of suicide, I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it, and here I am
In the presidential, do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin' through the street
Got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
Goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast, Lord
Seem like yesterday that I was up-and-coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here? The drink here? The girls here?
Well, fuck, let's get it then

Uh, I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask, ah

Are you down? Are you down? Yeah, you all the way down

Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She says, ""You're such a dog,"" I say, ""You're such a bone""

I know, I know you don't love me, baby

Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though

Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some

Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from

But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah

But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time

And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy

I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah

Yeah
I hate when, I hate when people say they feel me, man
I hate that shit
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me
If ever
For real

[Verse 1: Drake]
You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you, but it's not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fuckin' hates you and your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend ass keep gettin' thicker than the plot does
And when you forget her, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop, but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce, that shit right up your alley
Yeah, you see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
'Stead of gettin' a pat-down, they just keep on sayin' that they feel you, nigga, yeah
It's been too long
Been way too long

[Verse 2: Drake]
You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad, you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit card so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know it's real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503, some couches and paintings
Where you record with two others that want the same things
Yeah, it start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin' close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Tellin' stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on tellin' you they feel you, nigga
Yeah
It's been too long, man

I'm drivin' right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold, especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking what's good at home?
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I should've known
My young niggas poppin' M's and sippin' dirty Jones
Problem children that all be reppin' October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growin'
Brand new titties, stitches still showin'
Yeah, and she just prayin' that it heals good
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just prayin' that it feels good
I really don't know much, but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money, more problems, my nigga, don't believe it
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evadin'
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin'
Young money-maker, season-ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches, still scorchin' as if I didn't notice
You niggas gettin' older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater
Look at that fuckin' chip on your nephew's shoulder

Fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off-topic, don't I? I get it poppin', don't I?
I'll end up stoppin', won't I?
And by the time I end up stoppin'
You'll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin' with a nigga, don't lie
Uh, she's losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh

I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing

You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

[Chorus: Drake]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right

Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship

And this saddens me, I see the pecking order

Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, ""That ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
""Someone Like You,"" more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Lookin' in the mirror, I'm embarrassed
I'm feelin' like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man, arm wrestlin' hands I was dealt
When I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it, I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that'd keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar
Women love when you're my type
And you're winnin' from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all 'cause the audience one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse bein' read
I'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat, capitalize that
And your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Trackin' device on your used 5 Series
I don't call back, just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say we in the area cruisin' in Toronto
Hit me on the cellular, thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors, all that nigga was missin' was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality livin' in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the tastemakers for the shit we makin'
Then he said that he was the same age as
Myself, and it didn't help 'cause it made me even more rude and impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO
The reason why I'm breathin' all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend say she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why the highlight was when he said
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy
Full of fame and bury yourself alive, then I diedYou might also like125Embed"

Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel how you feel how you feel?

I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace, Mac Dre, I'm-a do it for the Bay

Tell Tune, ""Light one, pass it like a relay""

That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past

I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married

Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, ""Your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh

Alright, well alright
I say I do it for the love
Bunk bed flow, always one level above
If I’m in ya starting five you will never need a sub
And I’m neva looking down so I always know wassup
A picture won't do me Justice League in this bitch
I’ma do me trust this
Patience little label nigga you won't rush this
I got the hammer money sweetie you can’t touch this
I got a revolutionary flow in every scenario
Coming through ya stereo
Plus my girlfriend booty round like the merry go
Bitches like where he at, they be like there he go
And this verse deserve a burial
Don’t cry for me this ain’t motha fucking Mario
Yeah, and Polow isn’t at my session
Mr Anticipation Ima keep you niggas guessing like

Ok ok I’m grown, Im grown
Party at my house but I’m home alone

Counting everything I own in my muthaf-cking zone

Sue me and Ima put you on front street
Probably get your records pushed back like front seats
I’m much more then you fathom he would be
And ain't too many niggas that I’d rather be than me
I guarantee the women getting at him would agree
That he should go ahead and put a patent on his g
And I swear these niggas gassed up even though the price is high
I could own half as much clothing and be twice as fly
You know my coupe sit super low
Top slipped off like Janet at the superbowl

Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

Look, I know girls love Beyoncé
Girls love to fuck with your conscience
Girls hate when niggas go missing
And shawty you ain't no different
These days it's hard to meet women
Feel like my love life is finished
I've been avoiding commitment
That's why I'm in this position
I'm scared to let somebody in on this
No new friends, no, no, no
You know how this shit go
You got your fair share of admirers that call your phone
You try to act like it's just me, but I am not alone
But if you're alone, then

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say, ""Baby, I love you""
If you ain't running games

And this ain't no time for locking your phone and not coming home
And startin' some shit when I'm in the zone
This is why I've been saying

This is not four years ago
Time escapes me
Now forget how it felt when this shit move slow
I come through in whips that make a young boy take the long way home
All my young boys 'round me saying, ""Get money and fuck these hoes""
Where we learn these values? I do not know what to tell you
I'm just trying to find a reason not to go out every evening
I need someone that'll help me think of someone besides myself
I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more
Plus you're not shy no more
Neither of us wanna play the side no more
No, I'm not alone
Even though nothing was the same
Let me get your ass alone
Let me make you say my name
Say my name

Your new shit sound like you do covers
Of all of my old shit, oh shit
I'm devoted to making sure that shit goes unnoticed
Swear you niggas is hopeless
I should run a clinic for niggas that think that they winning
On some coach shit, 50 Ms for a three-month road trip
I see straight through them like fish tanks with no fish in them
Drizzy still got some '06 in him
IRS all in my books getting they Matlock on
All this capital it's like I left the caps lock on
It's like every time I plot a return I seem to shift the game
See I can still talk keys without pitchin' cane
Pay yourself and owe yourself
Before you come to my city just know yourself
Know where you at
I'm good in every town, I'ma be there doing shows where you at
The lights hit women screaming like Jodeci's back, nigga
[Interlude: Dennis Graham]
But that’s… that’s where all this... that’s where the feeling is
That’s where all that shit comes from… man I mean like

In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion

The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion

How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin' out of spite 'cause your man don't
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
Don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
[Chorus]
I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me, baby
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure

Worst—
Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub Js with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Motherfuckers never loved us
Man, motherfuckers never loved us

Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior
[Outro]
Remember?
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker

Comin' off the last record
I'm gettin' twenty million off the record
Just to off these records, nigga, that's a record
I'm livin' like I'm out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin' for the radio, but they'll still play it though
'Cause it's that new Drizzy Drake, that's just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough, nigga
Rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where don't shit matter to me, nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldn't reach, nigga
Prince Akeem, they throw flowers at my feet, nigga
I could go a hour on this beat, nigga
Yeah, I'm just as famous as my mentor
But that's still the boss, don't get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasn't meant for
'Cause you don't really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper, scary outcome
Here's a reason for niggas that's hatin' without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin' like starters, I hate it
Started from the bottom, now we here, nigga, we made it
Yeah, Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin' like a brick
Degenerates, but even Ellen love our shit

Sittin' Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel, Young Money, nothin' you could tell me
Paperwork takin' too long, maybe they don't understand me
I'll compromise if I have to, I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin' to Nicki, communication is breakin'
I dropped the ball on some personal shit, I need to embrace it
I'm honest, I make mistakes, I'd be the second to admit it
Think that's why I need her in my life, to check me when I'm trippin'
On a mission, tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin', I got some things that'll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3: Drake]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like ""Fuck it"", like ""YOLO""
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
[Spoken Outro: Curtis Mayfield]
If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin' yourselves?
If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

[Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn

And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down, girl, I always stay down
Get down, never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now
People I believed in, they don't even show they face now
What they got to say now? Nothin' they can say now
Nothin' really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now? What more can I say now?

Fuckin' on the low, smokin' on the low

The furthest thing from perfect, like everyone I know

And I hate that you don't think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin' shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened
I can't help it, I can't help it, I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's
And now you hate me, stop pretendin', stop that frontin', I can't take it
Girl, don't treat me like a stranger, girl, you know I seen you naked
Girl, you know that I remember, don't be a pretender
Gettin' high at the condo, that's when it all comes together
You know I stay reminiscing and make-up sex is tradition

I should have Spoons serve you up with a fork and knife for me
Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin' different

Naked women swimmin', that's just how I'm livin'
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feelin'

Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class

Hate when they get too attached to me

Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold

Find me a tutor, head game was smart to the point I was searching for knowledge
She just got her masters, something amazing you would think she fresh out of college
Shout out to Drizzy and OVO, and this shit I just got from Tokyo

Just incase they ain't hear what I stated, I ain't worried

[Verse]
Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, ""Okay, if you say so""
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end

Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, ""I feel you, nigga, I already know""
Yeah, already...

Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already

How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it; if I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it

Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger

She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Rider shit

[Verse 1]
Having conversations with mama, man, my life is a mess
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press
She got Google Alerts, them shits go straight to her phone
She worry 'bout me from home, you know she raised me alone
She said, ""I heard you back with you know who""
I told her, ""girl, I'm always back with you know who,"" yeah
And she like, ""Who are we kidding? You're 27, you're just being you
You're your father's child, man, thank God you got some me in you""
At least I always, at least I always see it through
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher, but your words still got me evolvin'
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solvin'
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that there's someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free Thursday
And I'm sure that she's an angel, but she don't want this life
The timing ain't right
Maybe one day, but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But I'm not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobody's confidence, momma
I got no friends in this, momma
I don't pretend with this, momma
I'on joke with this, momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it, momma
I'm Game of Thrones with it, momma
I'm Home Alone with it, momma
I'm t-
I really hate using this tone with you, momma
I really hate gettin' aggressive on this phone with you, momma
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two, momma
It's just they cloning me, momma
Them niggas wannabes, momma
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be, momma
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable, momma
I mean I kill 'em every time they do a song with me, momma
I sing a hook they sing along with me, momma
What more they want  from me, momma?
Yeah, this is a crazy life
But you and the six raised me right
""Don't ever take advice,"" that was great advice
You might also like[Refrain]
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life

[Verse 2]
Yeah!
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' 'bout dad
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real, girl, he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it, look how we're living
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like
I used to rap on the phone with one of his friends doing life
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny
Shit could've gone south for me, he looked out for me, ma
He never let me do drugs
He let me shoot a gun one summer, but out there everyone does
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music
Shit that can only be created if you go through it
I used to get teased for being black
And now I'm here and I'm not black enough
'Cause I'm not acting tough
Or making stories up 'bout where I'm actually from, yeah
But I just roll with it, momma, rolling stone with it, momma
Gotta be careful around Rolling Stone
Or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me, momma
I'm not condoning it, momma
They will not tear nothing down, I built this home for you, momma
Know I don't call enough, momma
I just been working with so little time for personal, momma, yeah

Shaq postin' up on niggas that I used to have posters of
Real quick, man, you couldn't have hated that
Let's be real, nigga, you couldn't have made it that, woo!
Dance how I dance, watch me dance
You're fuckin' with the best, man, I'm too advanced
After this drop I got new demands
Can't meet the terms, keep it movin' then
Make sure the plane got a phone now
So when we 'bout to land I can call to tell the woes I'm home now
I'll tell 'em link up at the valet at the Hazy
Think I got the shit that had the city going crazy
[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
When you get to where the fuck I'm at
You gotta remind 'em about where you been
About all of the money that done came and went
About the two cents I ain't never spent
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone
Boy, do I smell beef? Mmmm, pheromones
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry
I was only five, but still remember the drought in '87
Lord, tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em
I ain't got no time
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence
I'm fuckin' her mind
I got, mind control over Deebo
Parmesan my panino
Promethazine over pinot
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll, bitch
[Chorus: Drake]
I ain't felt the pressure in a little while
It's gonna take some getting used to (What you say?)
Floatin' all through the city with the windows down
Puttin' on like I used to (What you say?)
They never told me when you get the crown
It's gon' take some getting used to (What you say?)
New friends all in their old feelings now
They don't love you like they used to, man

Yeah, they don't love you like they used to (What you say?)

Yeah
Yeah
[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public

That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Verse 1]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 2]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us

But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)

But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah

These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies

I thought you wanted yours like I want mine

Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championship celebrations durin' regular season
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with
I'm legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to ""Closer to My Dreams""
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'
Y'all throw the word ""family"" around too much in discussion
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden
Now you the one gettin' buckets
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios
6 G-O-D, I think I
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.
And Young Dro was poppin' off with ""Ain't I""

Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Tongue kisses, stank hoes at the Coachella
Thank the Lord she never listen what a hoe tell her
Not only could I do better, but I know better
How could I ever be the king without a Coretta?
Feelin' like Rae, same damn 'Lo sweater
MAC 10, Beretta for the cold weather
Her ex let her blow cheddar, she a go getter
Hoe, clothes fit her, Moetter, but her flow better
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Keep machine gun strapped in case a nigga wanna act up
Petite gun raps ain't even strong enough to match us
Machine gun BLAT in case a nigga wanna act tough
Ain't nothin' like a bad bitch
That make a jiggy nigga wanna go and run up in that shit raw
Like Bruh Man from the 5th floor
I creep up in it, deep up in it 'til she tell a nigga, ""It's yours""
I know this shit is mine for the takin'
If I ain't in Mason it's some gay shit
Prolly why I don't react when you say shit
Half the times niggas don't even make sense
Know this shit is yours
When you do a world tour all off a mixtape shit
You know this shit is yours
When your face on every magazine cover, every page shit
You know this shit is yours
When you fuck a new different bad broad every day shit
Only get high just to compliment my maintenance
I took a little moment out to say this

I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing

And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours

[Bridge: Drake]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
[Hook: Drake]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then

Time to milk the game, bitch I went and bought a cow
My nigga GDK a goon, he'll gun you down
Slid up on him with the stick, yeah and sat him down
My nigga Nut so slick, they ain't pat him down
I got a hundred niggas on my line
A hundred squares at a time, nigga, hold it down

Cause my uncle was my father and my father was my nigga
And my mother so proud cause his son is gettin' bigger

I ain't the type to murder you, I'm more the type to plan it
So please take a seat if you really can't stand it
Got success in my pocket and these rappers in a panic
But Skinny told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me
Yeah, and to my city I'm the two-three

No bench time, nickname Starter Drake

And these other lames is hardly mentioned

I’m just a sicko a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try to say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those the strings that you can’t pull

One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white Hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Cliqued up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me

[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

It's a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

[Verse 1]
Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

You're so predictable I hate people like you

How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

[Bridge]
And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

Any time people want to start problems

Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no
Question is, will I ever leave you?
The answer is no, no, no-no-no, no, no
No, no-no-no, no, no
No, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute

Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Man don't live of a di hype huh?
Real ting ay
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see RiRi right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

[Verse 2: Drake]
I don't take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom

Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

Yeah
All you self-promoters are janky
We established like the Yankees
This whole fuckin' game thankless
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'
No limit to where I can take it
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper
I thought we looked out for one another
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble
I guess it's different in the city I come from
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me
The higher I get, the less they accept me
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha
No way out 'cause I'm already in it
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision
I been had it since ""No Scrubs"" and ""No Pigeons""
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching
""Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike""
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child
Can't nobody hold me down
Especially not right now
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile
Take that, take that
No love in they heart so they fake that
DiCaprio level the way they play that
Damn, nigga, what is that?
Y'all don't hear no songs
They hit my phone like, ""You did that""
They even hit my line like, ""Where you been at?""
It's always on some shit like
""When can I get a favor?"" or, ""Where my bitch at?""
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari
Look, now you got me started
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist
Always gotta play it smarter
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup
Cameras pointing every time I look up
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up
Sponsorship dollars is sky high
He be like, ""Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?""
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance
Yeah, redoin' the entrance
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit
And you still never quite get it
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this
Yeah, I make you dance to this
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder
Sun shinin', waxed tires
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays
These guys move so greezy nowadays
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it
Save my stories for down the line
I'm too ahead of the curve every time
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV

You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why? Man you know you know
Yeah and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggas every single thing I showed you
I'm here feeling like 50 back in ’02
And everybody sayin' I'm the man, so true
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'd be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin' like I'm bein' scouted 'til I'm out it

'Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin' I have nothing for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don’t get held up at the border
Yeah, so you can spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you can find my city on an atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid
And I'm still spendin' money from my actin' days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a seven-figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some fuckin' strings
So we're courtside when LeBron get a fuckin' ring
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there
You see that ’62 sittin outside? That's me there
I'm jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare
Putting in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin' I could have done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin'
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin'
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin' through the door
And kindly ignore, the paparazzi outside tryin' to record
Why has every woman never dined here before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Crus, the Gajas and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin' that that isn’t what your motive is
[Pre-Chorus]
They ain't rootin' for me, they ain't clappin' for me
I'm only sayin' can somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say I told you so

You hate it when I coat things all in sugar
You want to hear the real talk, well, girl, who wouldn't?

You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest
Then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xanned and perked up
So when reality set in you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?

[Verse 2]
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though you ain't lining thе trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like ""this what we need to be on, "" but you nеver went live
You middle man in this shit, boy you was never them guys
I can tell 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be trying to sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is
Me, I don't judge, I'm just going off what the math is
Numbers inflated
They all look at me like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest
Aw baby, stop debating, I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated

To the most high, I'm forever indebted
I know I gotta pay somethin', I know that day's comin'

Could feel my hand getting tired from holding the grudges
Two birds, one stone, my aim is amazin'
I need to start losing my shit on you niggas that's hatin'

Used to carry a lot of dead weight like a pallbearer
People too scared to tell the truth, so it's all dares
Count it, it's all there, and we all square
Quick money, I'm in and out
My dad used to use a soap bar 'til it's thinnin' out
But, shit, look at Dennis now, all Stacy Adams and linen'd out
More blessings for Sandi and him, more life
My parents never got it right
But God bless 'em both, I think we all alike
We all wide awake late at night, thinking on what to change
If we do get to do it twice in another life
Scared to go to sleep now
'Cause being awake is what all my dreams were like
Back when the bar that I had set for myself was out of sight
Tell me how I went and did chin-ups on this shit when I can't see it
Pin-ups of Meagan Good and Pam Grier
Soul sisters inspired my old scriptures
Now that feeling's gone like them old pictures
Mixin' liquor got us both twisted, words get so vicious
You just stare at me while you roll Swishers
Girl, I love you, but I don't miss ya
And no matter what year it is, I'm a 06er
Go figure, cold nigga, stay in school, man
Fuck the rap game, it's all lies and it's all filthy
Two percent of us rich and the rest of these niggas all milk it
Got two of my niggas off with a ""not guilty""
Gave back to the city and never said it if I didn't live it
But still, they try and tell you I'm not the realest
Like I'm some privileged kid that never sat through a prison visit
Or like it was just handed to me tied with a ribbon
I never worked to get it
But really it's you with all the drug dealer stories
That's gotta stop, though
You made a couple chops and now you think you Chapo
If you ask me though, you ain't lining the trunk with kilos
You bagging weed watching Pacino with all your niggas
Like, ""This what we need to be on,"" but you never went live
You middle-man in this shit, boy, you was never them guys
I can tell, 'cause I look most of you dead in your eyes
And you'll be tryna sell that story for the rest of your lives
Can't show us where the cash is, me, I don't judge
I'm just going off what the math is, numbers inflated
They all look at me, like, ""What have you done for me lately?""
""I like your older shit but wasn't in love with the latest.""
Aw, baby, stop debatin', I'm just a creative
My numbers out of this world
No wonder they got me feeling so alienated
You were the man on the moon
Now you just go through your phases
Life of the angry and famous
Rap like I know I'm the greatest then give you tropical flavors
Still never been on hiatus
You stay xann'd and perk'd up
So when reality set in, you don't gotta face it
I'm down 200 in Vegas but winning life on a daily basis
It seems like nobody wants to stay in my good graces
I'm like a real estate agent, putting you all in your places
Look what happens soon as you talk to me crazy
Is you crazy?You might also like67Embed"

And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop

Tryin' to figure out the whole thing

Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

Aww, man, fresh up out the sand, February tan
It's The Boy, but I'm still the man, come and get your mans
I don't know; first, you caught the hands, then you took the stand
It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand
On a yacht, me and all the dogs actin' like some dogs
We evolved, used to think vacation meant Niagara Falls
Swear to God, shout to Buffalo, never duckin' low
I don't stop, man, I'm stuck on go, always hug the road
Fuck a opp, make his body roll, yeah, a lot of those
Started out doin' college shows, Calipari flow
Then I popped like you never seen, we with everything
I went off in the '16, give me '17

[Chorus: Drake]
Want a lot, can't have everything, can't have everything
Want a lot, can't have everything, but I want everything

Bad attitude, tellin' who to calm down?
Tryna cool it all down, who's callin' my name?
Who's involved now? Tell me who I gotta down
I'll do a song now, man
Even though there's way less to prove to y'all now, man
Everything that went around is comin' back around
Y'all better hit the ground
Goddamn, beef forever unfinished
Yeah, it's all open-ended, had me off for a minute
Had you all since beginnin'

You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days.

And I, I wish time never mattered

Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though

Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute while I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dawg, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me

I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway. They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you. Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself. (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit

As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?

Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you
[Chorus: Drake]
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?
Did I? Did I?
Did I lose you?

Wrote this shit, January '21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city, wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person, first thing they say is, ""I know you need a break""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose, I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since

Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”
Mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin'
Fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans, but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God

J–j–j–just in my zone, I close my figures up
All your hoes chose me, nigga, calm down (yeah)

Louis pouch across my body, this is not for fashion
This is not a playground – ain't no fist fight, bitch, I'm blastin'
Niggas say they lookin' for me like I'm not right here, man
If I tatted tears, I'd be cryin' to my beard, man
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, I've been inside for thirteen years now
I've been on so many flights, it's like my record's clear now
A.k.a. the man, a.k.a. I never ran
Don't make me turn this red light on your head like you Roxanne
Only talk to bosses, not the second-in-command
Niggas bringin' talks to me, you better have a plan
'Cause they don't have a cure for all my pain
A.k.a. it's Not Nice and I live up to my name

Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 p.m. like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer

I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, ""I'ma done him for you""

[Verse 1: Drake]
Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin' the world feel some
They don't have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldn't even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us, gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino, I take 'em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of C-notes, get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms, I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop, but I was Sandra's rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like I'm Amber Rose
Yeah, fuck that, I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel, I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short, I gotta get it 'fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But it's gon' take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasn't made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin' numbers like I'm Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
I'm the chosen one, flowers never pick themselves

Niggas want a classic, that's just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese, you don't want drama, capisc'?
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious, you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin' and commas increase
I'm standin' at the top of where you niggas are climbin' to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key, jeez!
Spoiler alert: the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for me's askin' what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin' backwards
Like Charlamagne, I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and I'll be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we can't afford again
Like I said, can of worms and I'm the early bird
Niggas want to hang but I'm too busy doin' dirty work
Hit 'em back and say we'll link up on the 33rd
When I say that they cursin' me, it ain't dirty words
Church of Pentecost, Holy Spirit synagogue
I don't know who's protectin' me but we hit it off
Sandra's rose, no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are

Assuming the worst 'cause I haven't heard from you all weekend
Your silence is drivin' me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're duckin' calls or missin' calls
'Cause you've been so patient
I drink on the job and smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before

It's only good in my city because I said so
Just to fit the estate man, I had to Copperfield like presto
Voilà, tada (True)

Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

Here we go
Yeah

[Verse]
Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that it's not a maybe
That shit is in stone, sealed and signed
She not my lover like ""Billie Jean"", but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time, and all it took was one time
Shit, we only met two times, two times
And both times were nothin' like the new times
Now it's rough times, I'm out here on front lines
Just tryin' to make sure that I see him sometimes
It's breakin' my spirit
Single father, I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now I'm embarrassed to tell 'em I ended up as a co-parent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because I've been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I don't want you worry 'bout whose house
You live at, or who loves you more or who's not there
Who did what to who 'fore you got here
Nah, look, I'm too proud to let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it, I better make it
I promise if I'm not dead, then I'm dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I can't forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin'
Tell Gelo bring some Mod Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is short-lived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time, introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he must've brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin' so fast that they don't even really fit
But man, you know
I still had to get it for my boy though, you know
You haven't met your grandfather yet, that nigga a trip
He probably could'a did stand-up
Yeah, but at the same time, he's a stand up
And that's how you gon' be when it's time to man up
October baby for irony's sake, of course
I got this 11 tatted for somebody, now it's yours
And believe me, I can't wait to get a hundred more
Sorry I'm ventin', tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks, you're supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin' each other down
God willin', I got a good feelin'
You got a good spirit
We'll talk more when you hear this, my G

When I walk through the halls they move over
Stories of how we handle ours start to travel like a lone soldier

You hold your girl the same way that I hold composure
Or hold the wheel of the Fuji white Rover

Dodge sentences like they don't wanna discuss it, change subject

Man, fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Uh, uh, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it’s six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout to all my Asian girls, Dim Sum
Shots came I don’t know where they descend from
Probably some bad hoes, I’m 'bout to take your hemp from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only the real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I’m just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking about me going platinum in a year again
Don’t I got that shit the world, wanna hear again?
Don’t Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows just bore me, paint drying
I’m never tripping over anything that ain't mine
I’m hearing the shit that you say through the grape vine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It’s been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I didn't notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear

Yeah, okay
Lil CC on the beat, mmm
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
I mean, where the fuck should I really even start?
I got hoes that I'm keepin' in the dark
I got my niggas 'cross the street livin' large
Thinkin' back to the fact that they dead
Thought my raps wasn't facts 'til they sat with the bars
I got two phones, one need a charge
Yeah, they twins, I could tell they ass apart
I got big packs comin' on the way
I got big stacks comin' out the safe
I got Lil Max with me, he the wave
It's a big gap between us in the game
In the next life, I'm tryna stay paid
When I die, put my money in the grave

[Chorus: Drake]
When I die, put my money in the grave
I really gotta put a couple niggas in they place
Really just lapped every nigga in the race
I really might tat ""Realest Nigga"" on my face
Lil CC let it slap with the bass
I used to save hoes with a mask and a cape
Now I'm like, ""Nah, love, I'm good, go away""
Ain't about to die with no money, I done gave it

Mob ties, so I'm always good where I'm at

Roll with us if you really wanna get it (Get it)
Go get a half a million in the Sprinter (Sprinter)
Phone ringin', bitches know a big tipper (Tipper)
I got the hookup and there's really no limit (Limit)
Dead broke is in you nigga DNA (DNA)
Rickey Smiley's in Decatur with the yé
Lil' nigga, just another state case
Bury my motherfuckin' Chase Bank, time to bounce (Bounce)
Gotta count on my allowance (Gotta count on my allowance)
You niggas snitches so I gotta reroute it (So I gotta reroute it)
A nigga drippin' like I got a zillion dollars
Got the trap jumpin' like Zion when I rebound it
Then I'm out (Then I'm out)
And I'll never talk about it (About it)
The homies quiet, but we all smoke the loudest (Loudest)
Rich niggas and I'm really bein' modest
'Cause the way I do my deals, never treated like a artist
Want the house (House)

Nine figures was the goal 'til I hit it
These niggas ain't livin', so bury mine with me

Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the 20s up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater

Woi-oi

[Verse]
I don't cop things for resale, don't do iCloud, don't do email
Feds wanna tap up man and wire up man like Chubbs did Detail
Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza
Pasha Sasha pissed, I was way too young at the time for slashings
You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting
Everyone I know has codenames, anyone I'm beefin' with is a no-name

""Nah, just make sure, you know
You tell me what to do when I get there, you know?""
(June, you're a genius)
I said, ""I respect it, no problem""
I got all these blessings just to give it to others anyway
Know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, my hand's always open, for real

[Verse]
Ayy
Thirty-three years, I gave that to the game
Thirty-three mil', I'll save that for the rain
Five hundred weeks, I'll fill the charts with my pain
Five hundred mil' and I'll fall back in the 6ix
Finally give you niggas the space you need to exist
Michael Jackson shit, but the palace is not for kids
Still women sayin' it's childish, the way we live
Brought a few Ws to the 6ix
Baby mama fluke, but I love her for who she is
Baby, Wayne and Tez responsible for this shit
Half the time, I question my consciousness in this shit
Other times, I question if compliments are legit
Full-time, I'm out here confident as a bitch
Tryna make good on the promises that I give
Tryna make sure my accomplices are legit
Register the business in my brother's name
Thirty-five hunnid in her pocket, that should cover things
Certified lover man, trappin' out the motherland
Always move right so my watch is on the other hand
She can try and play it down now, but she was a fan
People wanna know what's in my pockets, they don't understand
My assistant always findin' Percocet and rubber bands
Know my mom might not want to hear how I discover plans
Word to Sandra Graham, no one love you like your mother can
I watched Michael Rubin win a million off a couple hands
I decide what to see next like it's on demand
I decide what to be next like I'm switchin' plans
I'ma tell you what you feel next like the weatherman
I will split heads and break necks for my little man
6 God, prayin' hands like I'm a religious man
But I'm just a sicker man, wicked man
Look, we can argue back and forth, but who's the richer man?
Isn't that what matters in this world that we livin' in?
Bang those dividends, snakes stay slitherin'
How you plan to make it to the top by just fittin' in?
How you plan to take a nigga's spot by just givin' in?
How you gon' treat this shit like you gon' get to live again?
How you gettin' hype off one hit? Do that shit again
How you got a manager you mad at after you got the win?
Bet you got some niggas that'll love you 'til the bitter end
Bet you got somebody that's just smarter than your other friends
Give 'em a percentage, see what happens to your blessings then
You just need to stay close to your people that was there when others could've been
There when others should've been
Got a nigga starin' at the game like, ""Damn, coach, put him in""
But you never listen, so you niggas goin' wood again
Got us in the crib, talkin' 'bout what niggas coulda been, shoulda been
And I got your girl on the second floor, beggin' me to put it in
And it's not because all of the money that you wouldn't spend
And it's not because I set it up to try and get revenge
It's because you niggas insecure, you ain't made men
It's because even though you hate on me, we stay friends
It's because you niggas never learn when to say when

Put that Christian Dior on a Muslim, she feelin' like she was sinnin'

I don't mean to admire you, just passion, I'm winnin' (D. Hill)
(Said I was in that UK, get closer to feelin' it)
Had to double back up my double-cup, yeah, yeah
You gotta put up out the city, she can't get any closer
Especially when you're driving a bandwagon after
You gotta put 'em on, she like that

Ayy, I should have put you somewhere where no one could find you
Mansion out in the sticks with nothin' around you

'Cause you got desires, I know, I know, I know (Hey)
'Cause you got desires

[Verse 1: Future]
You got that fire and I'm not a liar
You had me down on my knees everyday, had to talk to Messiah
I'm in that '81 and this that '82, this a different Ferrari, yeah
I tried to pay all of your loans off and cop you a driver, yeah
I had you stayin' too close to the city
You actin' too vulnerable livin' this life
I shoulda moved you away from Houston, before I copped you all this ice
You wanna be my number one, you're not actin' like the main thing

You should have did what you said you would'd do
You should be movin' in silence
See the type girl you hang with, the wildest
Need a better environment
I bought bags to fill up your closet
I pop tags, I know where I'm rounded
I do the dashes, get higher than the mountain
You need class to be with a celebrity
So sad, you lookin' like charity
What you wanna do? See niggas bury me?
All of my brothers are black, carry me
I can't answer you through the legacy
At the embassy speak, it was like therapy
Bought a Patek Philippe in your currency
Bitches can't keep it real with a nigga movin' so desperately
You the one that did the Twitter shit first to see how these hoes react
The only one that can make me feel some way 'cause I love you back
You wanna be my queen, niggas fuckin' on you, think I'ma take you back?
Your bags are secured at home, relax

For my nigga Hush
Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees
Smokin' on crushed leaves
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze
Straps over territory they know we must keep
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me?
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy
It's on Meech like it's trendy
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies
I need plenty
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over
I gotta bust it down, break it open
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'

Now we rollin'
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin'
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in
Now we rollin'

[Verse 2]
Look
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team
Runnin' missions
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians
Back when hotlines were still flippin'
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla
I always had a little somethin' extra
Back when Corey was our sole investor
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya
Look, I ain't no baller
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers
And easin' tensions
Keepin' family out of East Detention
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center
Spots we got no business enterin'
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
[Chorus]
Then we rollin', then we rollin'

Anybody feel any way about it, I don't give a fuck
(Yeah, family)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah
Yeah
Lost you to the game, I gotta hug that
I was here when you was asking where the love at
Dip your finger in the bag to get your buzz back
I was wishin' on a star when I was that
I've been fortunate enough to have it my way
I'm a fortune teller, listen to what I say
'Member when we used to park up in my driveway
I always told it how it was, I never shy away
This life is really something you get lost in
I know niggas that got famous and they bought friends
I had friends that only had half of they heart in
It's hard to accept now, and it was hard then
But I treated you like gold, I was all in
Spoiled rotten, they could smell you 'fore you walked in
Burnin' incense in your new apartment
But you got no sense when it come to
Lost you to the game, I gotta hold that
How you feelin' in your soul since you sold that?
I'll be better off without you, and we know that
You ain't lookin' at a nigga you could hold back

Niggas keep stealin' my style, now we out here matchin'
I did it by being myself with no dramatic acting
I couldn't sit around and wait, I had to have it happen
Lost you to the game, I gotta face that
Really think I lost you like a ways back
Always sayin' how a nigga never play fair
I took you up under my wing and you just stayed there
You was supposed to grow some wings, get your own pair
We started this from the bottom, now you alone there
Shit, you treat it like it's home there
Dependent on me, you was supposed to get your own share
I still love you to my last days
I never knew that shit would be this fast-paced
I never thought I'd see awards in a glass case
I could've ended up in your crib with a masked face
It could've went left on a couple bad days
When I visit my last place is the only time I'm in last place
See me these days, I never got on a sad face
See me these days, I
Lost you to the game, and I see why

Look, I'm sorry that I'm super late
I was drivin' here jammin' them Lil Boosie tapes
Understand that I do not envision, I hallucinate
I'm the type of nigga you could never ever duplicate, but
Let's talk about the babies me and you could make
We could do it anywhere, baby, you just choose the place
I hope I'm not being inappropriate
But maybe if I peak under the table, you could show me it?
Let me get a quickie, speed stick, no deodorant
To cover up the smell 'cause your parents are the nosiest
When you famous all the bitches wanna throw you it
But even with a bunch of women, you could be the loneliest
I tend to ask more than I can give
Or wait whatever's next and just get bored of what it is
That's probably why I'm keepin' you around
Was looking for exactly what I found

When these bitches start to writin' books about me
I just hope you stay down, yeah

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Everything about me cataclysmic
Big, obscure on every characteristic
I don't know what you're used to, but I'm a little different
Tremendous with credentials, resume is so prolific
Enough of that, despite I'm promisin' one in the booth
Always been a specialist at messin' with the best forbidden fruit
Never did I witness beauty so amazin', get it to the point when I see her, she glowin' like an angel with it
But after all the years of doin' it, I need an understanding with a woman good with followin' my lead
And though she finds it sexy and she loves that I'm the power, even in a crowded room, discreetly touching on her private
And when we goin' through a moment when we feelin' iffy
Believe in shit you hearin' while I question if you with me
You see that line of chicks? Let's go around the corner, waitin' and hopin' you drown, I just hope you stay down
I can't help the women lovin' everything about me, why you passin' judgement?
I just hope you stay down, yeah
I just hope you stay down

I know it's hard to trust me, all this money got my baby mama tryna fuck me

On my way to the boat like I ain't just have on a coat when I landed

Perched at the edge of the branches
They don't wanna talk mansions, mine look like a campus
And I'm all about my brothers like the niggas I'm samplin'
I'll leave you red-shirted like the twins from Kansas
Really livin' my dreams I used to have in my aunt's crib
Might throw a Rockefeller chain on in the Hamptons
This shit sound like I'm parked in the alley by ransom
My uncle went bankrupt and he was the last hope
My faith started to dwindle 'cause that was the cash flow
My mom would never walk again, that's what the doc said
So much medication, I was worried she'd drop dead
For real
And I was the good guy, my friends were the hotheads
Times when I thought I should of stuck with my old friends
I might've been at the end of my rope on both ends
The kids I went to high school with got trust funds
But we had more fun, trust
Textin' my promoter, homie beggin' for one plus
Girls wrote me off, didn't think I'd become much
Dinner and a movie all for nothin', that's tough love
Meanwhile, rappers from other cities is cuttin' up
We ain't had the means to really make it, we comin' up
But local niggas actin' like we made it and runnin' up

We needed to huddle up

'Til one of my niggas hit my phone like you want it or what?

Even if you ain't a Cancer, throw up your hands to this
'Cause most of y'all cancerous
Michael B. Jordan call you right now, you answerin'
Even if you got a man that love you, you scandalous
You gon' take the chance and shit
You know that relationship is probably in shambles
And you know you a fan of his
Know if he gon' bring you to Miami, you scramblin'
And pack all your luggage, get on the plane and land in it
Yeah, I'm just talkin' outta pocket now, I know y'all sick of me
I looked at the score and y'all can't be countin' the victories
It's still all love between us, despite all the history
It's still October forever, minus the trickery
Talk about a flip the switch challenge
It's been challengin' for ten years
'Cause niggas been out here switchin' on me
And showin' how much realer that some of they bitches can be
This shout goes out to Hov 'cause it's him and then me

Tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
I pray these niggas understand how passionate the tale is
To get you under my pressure
Richer
I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin'
To get you under my pressure
Yes, uh
Biggest, you feel me? (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Godfather with a garden full of snakes
Call Porsche, time to give away a Wraith
Bricks boy, tryna turn 'em into bass
Big boy, I been tryin' buy the Braves
Courtroom soundin' like I'm in the opera
Went and got it, now these niggas wanna knock us
Bitches fallin' 'cause they need a couple dollars
But it ain't a problem 'cause a nigga really got it
Fat boy, rich nigga, with a appetite
Count monеy all night under the candlelight
Spinnin' vinyl, Tеddy P, or is it Lionel?
Not a model, but I know I been your idol
Big bank, sparkin' weed without a lighter
On fire 'cause I'm just a different writer
Practicin' social distance with all these snitch niggas
Guess he jealous 'cause I had his favorite bitch with us
Big bucks, steppin' outta big trucks
Steppin' on my feet, it'll get you fucked up
Got the squad with me and all they did was gimme love
Foot Locker, twenty deep, a nigga spend a dub
G-Wagen for my bitch, that girl go live it up
Death row, that's for these niggas, I'ma hit 'em up
Makaveli, it's All Eyez on Me
Pinkie rings, it's still M.O.B. (M-M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, heart just turned purple
Three-sixty up front, it all comes full circle
Class photographs, Sandy had me on my Urkel
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Patty Mahomes, 'bout to fall short a couple hunnid
Signed, sealed, delivered, I fucked the notary public
She witnessed me sign off on some undeniable numbers
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, make a set sail in Croatia to get a leverage
Groundskeepers cuttin' the grass and clippin' the hedges
I took two mill' out the cage down in the desert
Matthew Maddox called in the pit boss, double checkin'
""The number's all good, just pay me, I'm at the Rhino""
Real life, the whole fam' goons like Ralo
One truck in front of me, one behind me to follow
Lemme get a lemon pepper order, please
You gotta have the link before you order these
Dockin' jet skis in the Florida Keys
We all grateful for Weezy, but no one more than me
You just found a bottle with the messages
These days, fame is disconnected from excellence
Half the time, I gotta ask niggas what they profession is
Ushered a generation in, these are where my confessions live
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
I did brunch with the judge we appearin' before
Private villas only, I don't go near a resort
We want everything galore, not just Lira Galore
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
For real, and my city love me like DeMar DeRozan
I sent her the child support, she sent me the heart emoji
They all say they love me, but they hardly know me
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, dropped him off at school, big day for my lil' man
Recess hits, daddy prolly made another M
School bell rings and I'm out there to get him again
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Yeah, teacher-parent meetings, wives get googly-eyed
Regardless of what they husbands do to provide
Askin' if I know Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Of course, pull up to the front in the fleet of Suburbans
Flooded French Immersion with the Secret Service
Shit is so obvious, it defeats the purpose
If this is your hobby, then come and meet your maker
Champagne, ring bells in the streets of Jamaica
Started at the crib, look how far this shit'll take ya
Ross sittin' on two hunnid thirty-five acres
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
And that's facts, Hamdan Mohammed like my third cousin (Facts)
Mansoor Mohammed like my real brother (Facts)
Dubai embrace me like a Emirati (Facts)
All my Rolls-Royces got a different body (Facts)
Mansory, kitted out with every option (Facts)
Lemme know if that's a problem (I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
If you got a problem with me, gotta walk around it
Used to say I had 'fore I got it, now I got it all
And bein' honest, I don't really wanna talk about it
And if I didn't have it, wouldn't wanna sulk about it
I had it so long, I don't even celebrate it
Negative thoughts don't even enter my inner matrix
'Magine me still rappin' 'bout if I never made it
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, not too many parallels left in our lives
I mean, my crib look bigger through my son's eyes
And the squad look bigger to the young guys
And my dick feel better when you drunk, right?
Spend nighttime starin' at the sunrise
And my diamonds all hittin' like tie-dye
Air Canada Centre nigga when I die
Y'all gon' have to fly in and do your fake cry
First couple rows, you gon' see the real guys
The ones that purchase they vehicles 'cause their trunk size
The ones that look at other rappers like it's lunch time
Watch on my wrist never showed me crunch time
'Cause I ain't never let it come to that one time
To be real, man, I never did one crime
But none of my brothers could caption that line
At all, kill me, that's talent God wasted
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
When mama was too tired to cook and we had the basics
Instant noodles, sriracha, I still taste it
Now it's a movie, I'm back at Bellag', wasted
Niggas love tryna put my back where the walls facin'
Big body frames, wasn't into car racin'
Me and Chubbs drive by, shorty heart racin'
I always end up droppin' the top when it starts rainin'
Livin' in the 6, eight weeks, sun blazin'
After that, the killers just go into hibernation
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Damn, rest in peace Dolla Bill
How I get a girl and girls still wanna holla still?
How I'm so famous, gotta live where they hide the hills?
(I been tryin', tryin', tryin', tryin')
Everybody that survive got survivor's guilt
My label gotta prove they love me, gotta wire mills
My boy kitchen's done, lookin' like a flour mill
You niggas' faces lookin' like you drink sour milk
And your albums like some mothafuckin' fire drills
It's like this shit feels real, but it's never real (Yeah)
[Outro]

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter (Skrrt)
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up

Just hung up the phone and I
Could already tell that you're comin' home intoxicated, ooh
So you better take your time with me
'Cause I remember last time you wouldn't make love to me
Then you fell fast asleep (I hope you niggas sleep)
Wouldn't even talk to me, no
Say— Say I'm so crazy, baby (I'm so crazy)

[Chorus]
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
Please, for me
Since you're comin' home intoxicated, oh
For me, please
I wanted you to race my mind, yeah

[Verse 2]
They said you got high as the sky
Up all night just dancin', huh
I hit you like, ""Please come home to me"" (Come home to me)
But you're not understandin', no
You gon' make me beg, make me plead (Plead)
I wanted you to race my mind, I got the keys
I just figured you could make time for me

Picture me rollin' through downtown in a A4
Picture my signature on a pair of some J 4s
Picture me carin' what niggas sayin' on Wi-Fi they don't pay for
Knew I needed love, but I think I value the hate more
To push towards things that I prayed for
Retrograde energy shifts are what I was made for
And don't you dare hit me back with no ""K, sure""
Soon as I tell you that you the one I would wait for
You too saucy, too flossy, you moved in and moved off me
All to be with niggas who just startin' to move bossy
Maybe I just handled you too softly
Them boys got no Kelis in they blood
If your whole heart wasn't in it, I know a piece of it was
Posted that pic you sent me, it wasn't recent enough
How I'm supposed to wife it? You not Ayesha enough
You love getting T'd up
Love showin' the cakes, you know that they eat it up
Love touchin' the road as soon as it's heatin' up
Invited you over, you said that you showin' up
All them spelling mistakes, I know that you drunk as fuck
All them other mistakes, let's let it be what it was
Them niggas just can't understand it
I want you to change my mind, I'm praying you pulling up
Know who you be around, I know that they teaming up
Telling you you better off leavin' me in the dust

Yeah (Huh)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Look, me and Lil Sandra bagging CDs in the bubble wrap
People recognize me from the TV, but I'm done with that
People don't wanna see me succeed, this shit come with that
Even when I come back, I don't know if it's me that's gonna be coming back
Soon as I left, I had to make peace with that
Dropped out of school 'cause nobody was teaching that
The Best Western is where a nigga was sleeping at
Daemen College booking me to pull up and speak the facts
Even if they make a movie 'bout us, this shit'll be hard to re-enact
Dislocated shoulder, it's hard to be always reaching back
All these IOU's, it's hard for me to be keeping track
Friends that dedicated they life to just keepin' me intact
Hard to pay 40, pay Noel, pay Niko back
All the nights I needed to vent to someone and CJ sat
All the nights Chubbs was pulling up where I need him at
All the times Mark was making sure that my luggage packed
Or times he had to double back (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I mean, even with his salary, you can't put no prices on that
There is no salary cap, there is no payin' him back, for real
I wonder what it could've been if I had snakes in the mix
Actually, I never wanna know 'cause we made it like this
Shots gotta fly either way, now I make it or miss
Overtime hours all good, we take it in shifts
What would you do if it wasn't this? That's a hard one
The finish line is where I like to pull up and start from
Pain is just a place that I go to get the bars from
Anxiety's a drug that I use to get the job done
Delusional's a space I like to think that I'm far from
My son is the one thing I hate to be apart from
Bet against me, don't know where they getting the odds from
I know that when it's done, I'm going wherever God's from
But I still don't know where I get the calm from

[Verse 2]
Look, gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
Sometime it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
Like, how they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's whatever with them niggas on the other side
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die (Yeah)
My hard work doesn't just pay off, it pays all the family debts off
I'm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff
Houses paid off, label paid off
My soul for the money wasn't the trade-off
Unlike most of you boys that fade off
I feel guilty taking some days off
Please don't google my net worth, the numbers are way off
I mean, if you comparin' it to what I really made off with
I'm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off
Trust me it was nothin' light, holmes
They tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home
I know you love me
Can't picture bein' a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on
Unless Kawhi wanna run it back
Other than that, the strings'll be unattached
Certified Lover Boy, I'm not the one for cuddling or none of that
Y'all music gets watered down, when you love 'em back
And you know what I'm on, blowing past ya, owning masters
Said you're like a father figure to me, but now daddy's not around so I'm a bastard
Oh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more
Soft spot for all the ones that came before, I can't ignore it
I'm always tryna rekindle
From the bottom to the top, man, what's it like in the middle?
From the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter
To my dogs in the game who wasn't pick of the litter
For the young Gs out here starting from the beginning
Nobody praying for you when you winning, don't forget it (Winning, don't forget it)
[Outro]
Woah, woah, woah-woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah-woah, woah
Woah, woah, ah
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Yeah (Ooh, yeah)
Said it's hard when it starts to fade away
Hard when it starts to fade away
It's hard when the memories start to fade away
Said its hard when the memories start to fade away

And you know, told me lotta things, but ain't say everything
But now I know every single thing, there was plenty things I didn't know
Plenty things you didn't say, was fuckin' with you anyway
Was fuckin' with you way before you had some confessions to make
You decide to take it to the grave, I know you gon' take it

Money callin' so I threw the deuce up
Yeah, they plottin' on me but they gotta do somethin'
Told my dawg two-somethin' just to shoot somethin' (M-M—)
Left them niggas stretched out on the train tracks
Rather you than me, here come that payback
Got 'em lookin' for that paper that they can't tax
Yayo so clean, I told 'em call it, ""Ajax""
Hialeah celebrated when Fidel died
Patti LaBelle, who knew that we would sell pies?
Standin' on your own is when you realize
When all the lights go out, that's when you see the real guys
Back to the real niggas glowin' in the dark (M-M—)
Never perfect but you know a nigga heart
A rich nigga that'll pull up to the park
Get on one knee and tell the kids that they are stars
Bullet wounds don't be covered by ObamaCare
Your funeral was way too soon, that's if your mama there
Real niggas deserve to live twice (M-M—)
Plastic fork and some fried rice

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, two-point-two for the Rafael Nadal
Don't act like you're happy for me now
Don't act like you wasn't prayin' for catastrophic collapses
Catalog is immaculate
Still runnin' the game, don't ask me about the practice
Ho, you go on vacation, don't ask me about relaxin'
Not sure if you know but I'm actually Michael Jackson
The man I see in the mirror is actually goin' platinum
Unthinkable when I think of the way these niggas been actin'
Yeah, I never did you nothin' and you play like we family, huh?
Next thing, you wanna shoot me down, it can't be love
Not sure where you was tryna send it, it can't be up
That day you sounded like a bitch, you fancy, huh?
Damn, how can I forgive like this?
I gotta dead a lot of shit just to live like this
I had to fuck a lot of girls to get a kid like this
I had to get a lot of cribs to get a crib like this, nigga
That's why I'm movin' all elusive

Said you belong to the streets but the streets belong to me
It's like home to me (She belongs to the streets)
It's like home to me
I tatted your passport up
Now it's lookin' like a arm sleeve
Just know that was all me

[Verse 1]
And when you see Chanel, I wish that's how you saw me
That shit you tell Chanel, I wish that's how you called me
That raw shit, that honesty, yeah
You know I love you more than all them niggas put together
And it's a lot of niggas' trust, I put the list together
And it's a lot just to assume we're meant to be together
You gotta live that shit for real, you can't just say whatever
You could never tell nobody that you held me down
If it was ride or die then you should've been dead right now

[Chorus]
So I don't get how you're yelling at me
How much I gotta spend for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
How deep I gotta dig for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)
All the things I've done up until right now (Right now)
I need a thousand pages just to write it down (Write it down)
Writing down these feelings, it's been overdue (Overdue)
Don't know how many pens it's gonna take to get over you
How much I gotta pen for you to pipe down? (Pipe down)

I can't believe you told me it was ride or die
'Cause you're not here, somehow you're still alive
True enough I know you from the other side
I set my expectations way too high
Yeah, and I would listen to the lies that you would tell all night
Angel eyes, but you've been giving me hell all night
I know the book that you would write is a tell-some, not a tell-all
Just to make sure you well off, you would sell all rights
Why does your ex think we beefin', is that man alright?
That nigga can't even look at me, he fell off twice
And I'm back poppin', I still remember the day I saw you
I was on your ass like back pockets
Niggas love to hate, but what is that stopping?
So much shit I wanted to say, straight to your face
'Cause you're so two-faced, that I don't know which face
You're the reason we'll be going separate ways
You're the reason we cannot communicate
It's not the things you say, it's what you don't say
I'm not in your way, you're in your own way

Yeah (Go Squad)
Ayy
Look

[Verse]
I wish everyone could tell me exactly what they need from me
The first second they speak to me, I'm not with all the secrecy
Secretly beefin' me behind closed doors
But playin' it peacefully for the streets to see
My nigga, have some decency
Don't move like a puto
Could at least keep it a buck like Antetokounmpo
I made north of the border like Vito Rizzuto
Throwin' parties in Miami, they lovin' us mucho
With the ho ratio, I'm like David Caruso
Thеre's a mad shortage of peoplе givin' me kudos
I been doin' this since T-Pain was pourin' us Nuvo
You tell 'em I run the country, they'll say, ""True, though""
Papi chulo, grippin' culo
And I got the flows niggas steal like boot toes
You boys reachin' new lows
Lettin' me take the rap for that Casper the Ghost shit
While you findin' all of the loopholes
You niggas move too cold
See the watch collection and assume I got time
'Cause of the ruby rose two-tone
Or switch it to the one I call ""R.I.P. Nipsey""
'Cause I swear to God the bezel got sixty of them blue stones
Maybe I'm gettin' too stoned
Calacatta marble for my tombstone
Here lies a nigga that never lied in his new song
Or any of his old songs
They sing them shits like folk songs
Kumbaya, boom-ba-ye
Know the owl stay on me
Bad bitches tryna come through and lay on me
Tryna get the earl grey on me
But I ain't really into talkin' names
Only tee you're getting from me is one for the walk of shame
Heart is on my sleeve and my body is in the hall of fame
High fashion and my life is full of climaxes
And my wishes come true without blowin' eyelashes
Up in 'Bron crib, fishbowl wineglasses
That's how we passin' time
Hundred thousand on the line
At the table prayin' banker shows a natural nine
It never happens half the time
My losing nights are still a vibe
That's the things I accept
You over there in denial, we not neck and neck
It's been a lot of years since we seen you comin' correct
Man, fuck a ""Respectfully,"" I just want my respect
They tried to label me mean, I say what I mean
People that could've stayed on the team
They played in-between
Clouds is hanging over you now, 'cause I'm reigning supreme
Some of these niggas say what they mean, it ain't what it seems
Had to pull my niggas out the mud like I'm trainin' Marines
You niggas hot to them little kids, you ain't famous to me
Told you I'm aimin' straight for the head, not aiming to please
I could give a fuck about who designing your sneakers and tees
Have somebody put you on a Gildan, you play with my seed
Trust me, there's some shit you really gotta come see to believe
That's why your people not believers, they all leavin' ya
That's why you buyin' into the hype that the press feedin' ya
You know the fourth level of jealousy is called media
Isn't that an ironic revelation?
Give that address to your driver, make it your destination
'Stead of just a post out of desperation
This me reachin' the deepest state of my meditation
While you over there tryna impress the nation
Mind's runnin' wild with the speculation
Why the fuck we peacemakin', doin' the explanations
If we just gon' be right back in that bitch without hesitation?
But let me digress on behalf of the association
I'll play it cool with you, then mark a nigga like Copenhagen
See, they gettin' loose with the line like open cages
In the La Ferrari, my emotions racin', dancin' out a condo, ocean bathin'
Niggas textin' ""Bro,"" but we are not of no close relation
I was down to give these niggas credit, but hold the payment
Somehow I'm the greatest in the game, to my own amazement
The greatest in the world, there's no debatin'
You boys 'bout to wheel me to defeat like we rollerbladin'
Far as the Drake era, man, we in the golden ages
Look at the total wages
And look at the heroes fallin' from grace in their older ages
If we talkin' top three, then you been slidin' to third like stolen bases
Toss around Rollies with frozen faces
They used to tell me back in the day, ""Boy, you're going places""
Never understood where I could really take it

I remain unfazed, trust, worse has been done
Man, fuck a valuation, show me personal funds
It's the pretty boys versus the petty boys
Sold that already, got a whole new set of toys
Shit is so surreal, Drizzy Drake, you better enjoy it
Nothing else bigger than the OVO letterman boys
Cashmere knits for the nighttime boat rides
Ollie got the first еdition parked up roadside
The only sign of strugglin' is coming from thosе guys
I'm tryna just relay what I can see through my own eyes
And nothin' tell the truth like the eyes will
Lived so much for others don't remember how I feel
Friends in high places and friends that are high still

They don't want a problem with the boy, but it's goin' to be
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be

The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

Long way down from the heights I'm chasin'

Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper

When I could destroy you, that takes some fuckin' discipline
I could send a team to come drill you

Niggas gotta chill with talking gangsta
You should just thank us, humble yourselves a little bit
This ain't the same Shawn that you knew once
I don't shine shoes, uh, this ain't what you want, no

Nigga, we don't tennis that, y'all gotta do something, yeah
Only thing we 'spect now is violence
Anything besides this, we playing violins, uh

I know that I hurt you
Yeah
I was a child trying to be a man
To all my sons worldwide
I walked out on my only son
All my juniors
I left you in your mother's hands
I apologize for my absence, I know I left you without an annual drop
And now I'm standing right here
I don't know how I expected you to get your clout up and get your money up, but
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes
Don't worry
See your mother raised a fine young man
Daddy's home
And I know I missed so much of your life
Turn me up (Mario)

[Verse: Drake]
Yeah
Niggas know they need to stop
I'm standing at the top, that's how I know you never seen the top
Sierra Canyon parking lot lookin' like Magic City parking lot
Hear the talks when I walk by like you know it's over when we drop
Ayy, drop
Yeah, and I'm coming with the wop
Y'all niggas not poppin'
Fuck her, then she goin' shoppin'
Woah, I'm runnin' out of opps
They're runnin' out of options
Put 'em up for adoption
Sign my name on the dot
Ayy, this is not luck, baby, this no four-leaf, no horseshoe
I'm in the bank thinkin', ""Poor you""
I'm in New York goin' Jon Chetrit
Supermodels and they all sexy
Lock the door to the bathroom 'cause they doin' something that is not Pepsi
I'm just pourin' up the shots
I remember that I told you I miss you, that was kinda like a mass text
I remember that I told I loved you, that was really in the past tense
I remember that I told you I get you, truth is that I get around
Mentioned havin' us a kid, '42 hit, I tend to kid around
Yeah, on Benedict with the top down
Shorties out here gettin' knocked down
City coming off a lockdown
Rap niggas doing weak features for a pop artist 'cause they popped down
Used to wanna throw the Roc up, niggas know how I rock now

Big owl, big birds forever
Don't make me go get your mama to talk to you
'Cause if he gotta get your motherfuckin' mama to talk to you, you know what I'm sayin', I'ma bring that motherfuckin' big switch out
At this point, I'ma start collectin' child support the opposite way
You gotta pay me to be my motherfuckin' son, ha-ha-ha-ha

[Outro: Drake & Montell Jordan]
Look at me
Take a real good look at me
Don't turn away
Don't you turn away like I did my son
Look me in the eyes, junior
I'm making no more promises

I'm trying to find the word to say

I'm still working on me
And I'm coming back better for you (I'm comin' back, oh-ooh)
Most times it was my selfishness and your helplessness that I took advantage of
You sit in the house and I be out and I know you're worried, up (I know you're worried, you're worried, you're worried)
And you try and block it out
I'm so sorry for letting you down (Oh-oh, oh-ah)

[Refrain: Drake]
I should've came home, came home sooner
You'd probably still be there if I
Came home, love you like I treat ya
You'd still be there
My girl, my lil' baby speechless
You'd still be there, baby

[Verse 2: Drake & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'm still working on me (Work it)
And I'm coming back with a plan and there's money in my hand, baby (Work it)
You said I was fucking up when I was out here fucking fans, damn, and it made you look crazy
Made you seem, made you feel, it was crazy (Ooh-ah)
While you sit in the house, I be out and you stay worried about me (Oh)

[Verse 3: Drake]
Ayy, yeah
Nights when I just needed to hold somebody
Feeling overwhelmed, should've told somebody
Picturin' it's me sending chills through your body
I just probably should've chilled 'til I saw you
How am I supposed to get to know somebody?
Nigga left his 20s and I still wanna party
I can not be trusted on my own with nobody
I can not be
If we broke it off then you know it wasn't painless
If she got a watch then you know it's not a stainless
I was out here fucking fans, I was shameless
Yeah, and I know that
You was at the crib reading stories that they sent you
Most of that was bullshit but some of it I did do
Hard for me to justify the women I was into
Especially when the whole entire world wished they had you
Then I locked the door that night in Vegas 'cause I had to
Then I had a kid even though I never planned to
I cannot imagine when your girls gave you that news
I know that
Probably made you want to hit the streets on everything
Probably made you want to pour bleach on everything
Probably made you want to kill me on everything
Yeah, trust, I know that (Trust, I know)
Calendar must say two, zero, one, four
'Cause you're on the same shit that you was on before
I know you're not happy, girl, everybody know
Could see it in your boyfriend eyes at the show
Don't tell me let it go, I'm a letting go pro
You don't wanna grow but we gotta outgrow
Went six digits on the lock screen code
You crack  into that ho and it's gon' be a lot of smoke
We both getting rich but the trust getting broke
Tear me down with words but I know that's how you cope
Cover up a lot, can't cover up your soul
Know you're not happy, girl, everybody know

Hard to tell people that I'm all out of favors
Call me for songs or they call me for paper

And you know how it goes when I see you again
You know I'm making my way to your ends
And you know I need you to be there for me

Text you but I know you probably courtside
No, I got to come and check the whole man, baby, hold tight

And we got it adopted by some fifth ward strangers
You know what it means when I twist these fingers

I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

[Verse 1: Drake]
I can't just be with you and only you
Yeah, I got one, Virgil got one and that there is the only two
Man, how many times have I shown improvement?
How many nights I been (Woah)

Not tryna fuck up the wheels on the road, okay
Funny how life goes

Soon as you give 'em your soul
You blow up and they say you're sеlling your soul, okay
They want my life exposеd
They wanna know about the highs and lows

And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six

She knows I'm sinning again, she knows
Good God, damn, I can't get shit by you

Fuck a pigeonhole, I'm a night owl, this a different mode

Heard you with a shooting guard, just let a nigga know
I would have you courtside, not the middle row

Plus I'm cookin' up ambition on a kitchen stove
Pot start to bubblе, see the suds, that shit good to go
Hoes say I'm suave, but I can't get RICO'd

Love the way they hang, babe, fuck the silicone

Bustdown everything, set in rose gold

Still steppin' like Omega Psi Phi for mine
If bein' real was a crime, I'd be doin' life
Like that nigga not nicе, I don't know polite
I'm the first evеr antisocial socialite
The pain that I seen in my mother's eyes in 2009
Have me workin' 'til it's 2049
And get hate when I tell you, ""Oh, some other time""
Like I really got some other time
You just tell me, ""Never mind""
Know I sound crazy to a lazy mind
Know it'll be a different kind
Shout out to the people workin' nine to five
I be workin' nine to nine
And the six upside down, it's a nine
You already know the vibe
And they leave 'cause of pride, but they comin' back every time
The devils that I recognize, most of them got pretty eyes
Titties and some plans of just gettin' by, that's the way they live or die
Easy to judge, but, girl, who am I?
Truth or dare, I'ma take a double dare
Truth is a suicide
I would rather live a lie, keep you on the outside
Introduce you to the guys
Have you throwin' up the south side like you're one of mine
But you're not one of mine
You belong to everybody else when you're bored in your free time
Shit could make a thug cry, play it like a tough guy
Couldn't even land in the Hamptons, they didn't have the stairs for the shit I fly
Swear it's like a metaphor, I can't even get down from the shit I climb
Can't even get down from the shit I climb
Yeah, girl, you're my size
Make me tell you one time
We was on the front line, shit was in my bloodline
Waitin' for the sunshine
But the sun never shines on me, on me
Sleepin' in the whip sometimes, girl, I was sleepin' upright
Henny, red cup life, broski kept it tucked tight
Niggas talkin' bare shit about what they gon' do to mine
Aw, now their tongues tied
We was smokin', watched the sun climb
I would trap until my thumbs cried
Tryna change it all in one line
Never seen a thug cry
Love, it's been a long time
Bet you never seen a thug cry
Hit me on my hotline
And no, ma, I'm not fine at all

We goin' from the Vava to Cinquante-Cinq, then back to the Vava
If you know, you know, baby, I don't, I don't know what to tell you
Yeah

[Verse: Drake]
Look
Long way from Sette Mezzo
Meet Tommaso and Ernesto
Short rigatoni with the pesto
These verses are my manifesto
Hallways got an echo
Me and Smiggz on the loose in the city, you know how the rest go
Casual sex, I'm like, ""Fuck a dress code""
The first martini is an espresso
Chill shot glasses with prosecco
Niggas so ignorant in our hood, they bе like, ""Why the fuck you makin' techno?""
I'm worldwidе and this is just another cargo jet flow, I had to let go
Life insurance policies, you niggas 'bout to need the gecko
I got some meaner threats, though
Me, Spider-Man, and Leonardo, I'm back tomorrow
I had the chopper to a wedding out in Monaco or Monte Carlo
I'm losin' track of where we all go
I wouldn't trade my life for none of y'alls, it's an embargo
Fifty-nine bags on the 767, this is heavy cargo

Fifty-nine bags on the—, ayy

For your birthday, your boyfriend got a party bus
Bottle signs, club lines, should've come with us
We left that shit in '09 when we was comin' up
I mean, these just my suggestions of course
EmRata here fresh off divorce
And I'm tryna look in her eyes, maybe express my remorse
If she want a rebound with me, I'm down to go get her some boards
I'm here for the moral support
Whippin' the Vespa off of six tequilas
Big Benjamins like the Pittsburgh Steelers
Drake, you got it
Robert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic
You would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product
Teachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff
Might be the only teacher that gets paid enough
That's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods
You niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris
If we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs
Come to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy
First got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me
No chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy
They underestimated my trajectory
But now they gotta pay that shit direct to me
I send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just—
Independent women is lovin' the new appearance
Matter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris
Like, ""Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus""
I got my head in the clouds, I'm serious
The lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods
Promise you'll get that shit when the sky clears
This shit designed for divine ears
My favorite two words from you white boys is, ""Sign here""
And then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers
Swear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years
And then we 'bout to kick this shit in high gear
Eight karats like vegetarians, nigga, the earrings are droopy
Contract Lord of the Rings, think it's a script for the movie
Shout out TVGUCCI, my cousin is spooky
I swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie
Sidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie
He claim we don't got a problem but
No, boo, it is like you comin' for sushi
We might pop up on 'em at will like Suzuki
Kawasaki, sushi, saké, the money grow on trees like shiitake
They tried to get spicy with me, so I wonder how they gon' stop me
I'm really on a roll like hamachi
The fuck would y'all really do without me?
For your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi
Last time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee
And Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi
Quavo might've sent me a song that he called ""Versace""
I really can't remember it properly
All I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large properties
Treat me like a newborn, Lucian not droppin' me
I'm goin' Pink Floyd, you niggas cannot rock with me
She could be givin' me head and somehow you not toppin' me
Niggas see the 6ix God pass, they high-fivin' me
Need to be high-sixin' me
Swear niggas highkey sick of me
They wifey on my head 'cause I vibe differently

Took if from signing my own yearbook to booked for the year
Got a condo and I couldn’t even cook for you here
Took it from bs checks to TSX
To people wondering if its the Phantom he gets next
Who knows, its the rabbit its buzzing for real here
The rapper everybody got a cousin he’s feeling
Its kinda ironic you fit with them
Cause they wasn’t really around when it wasn’t appealing
Now its denim diamonds an perfume spraying
Four star rooms are the worst you stay in
(I love the line about the range with the rims to match)
What girl that wasn’t me who’s verse you saying
Shit I would never tell you nothing like that
Them other niggas you spend on, cuff em like that
See the difference with me I don’t forget the past
And you gave me nothing so I’m gonna give you nothing right back, like…

Where were you when I...
Would’a loved the person you trying to be now

No debts owed we can both let go
Before this I could never get a call from ya
Now all texts finish XOXO
But this ain't hollywood squares to me
Sweetie I’m far from a hollywood charity
And I bet when you talking to your friends
You messing with other dudes that you probably compare to me
But if its not Drake and one of us wrong you forget my birthday and know none of my songs
You coulda told me before your heart wasn’t in it, fine
But try to get a start at the finish line

Yeah
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I haven't been able to see family for a while
That shit is wearin' me out
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
I even got the cleanin' staff plotting extortion on me
My parents' divorce is on me
My therapist's voice is making the choices for me
And I always censor myself 'cause no matter what, they reporting on me
The pressure is weighin' on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
My soulmate is somewhere out in the world just waiting on me
My chef got the recipe for disaster baking slowly
My heart feel vacant and lonely, but still
I'm makin' the most of this shit and more
Every single move is like rolling dice on the board
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
I'm bigger now than before
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How could anybody tell you the truth when they misinformed?
How the niggas turnin' up with you turned you in for rewards?
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
**** windows of opportunity, let me go through the doors
This the part where I don't ever say ""Pardon me"" anymore
This the part where I'ma find a new part of me to explore
This the part where all my partners know what we in it for
This the part where we gon' throw us a party after the war
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure

They just keep blocking out the sun
It seems since I was born
I've wakened every blessed morning
Down on my luck and up against the wind

[Verse: Drake]
Gotta hold my head high with two dry eyes
I told you everything is fine, dawg, but I lied
I be tryna draw the line, but it's a fine line
And I'm drownin' out the noise from the sideline
But it's louder than the voice I got in my mind
I can't even hear myself when I get quiet time
How they tellin' me I'm done, when I'm in my prime?
They've been tryna push a narrative since '09
And they even had my ass convinced a couple times
But that ain't even the half, I had tougher times
Only look for sympathy inside my mother's eyes
And it's still, ""Fuck them niggas on the other side""
We got problems we could never really put aside
I cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside
I tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldn't die
So now I kill 'em all for acting like they couldn't die
And I do it all for this little hood of mine
And now I'm top opp to these niggas, what a time
Raise 'em like a son, and still they said he couldn't shine
Fuck it, I'm the one, I ain't worried 'bout the other nine
Checking on my brothers help, making sure my brother fine
Making sure my mother's fine
Pass it to my son next, make him throw another dime
Tryna find the right one, give her ass some butterflies
Eleven years deep now, getting hard to summarize
Niggas tryna diss me, gotta tell a bunch of lies
Shit don't even cut deep, cutting like some butter knives
Man, I got a hundred lives
Pushing through the pain, that's why I look like I ain't troubled by
More I start piecing shit together, more I'm puzzled by
Fame'll have you feelin' like you're really living double lives

All around paid can't even get a sentence free
So judge a nigga sweetheart sentence me
I ain't worried it's going to happen if it's meant to be
And if you ever feel like you need to step inside
Be a woman about it and know we live separate lives
Try to tell you less feelings means less goodbyes

No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out The Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it's over with
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I'm just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me

I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts
And never placin' second

People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that’s takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That’s not respectable all of a sudden?
I don’t get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Half a percocet and my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of

[Verse 1]
No snow tires, the Range slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out The Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin’
Not when everybody out here beefin'
We got it, now we just gotta keep it
America's most wanted, man, I’m still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings, but I'll still gеt you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin' dumb
Pleasе never label niggas who lay down for a livin'
My competition, it's beyond offensive
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission
This the remix to ""Ignition,"" hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when it’s over with
I need to start sayin’ shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin' times, revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
I’m just takin' what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on world-class finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin’ efforts
And never placin' second
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second
Inspirin' and never takin' credit
I know I deserve more, I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?

Slime You Out by Drake (Ft. SZA),2023-09-15 00:00:00,For All The Dogs,7,"190 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsРусскийEspañolDeutschItaliano日本語Slime You Out Lyrics[Intro: Drake]
I don't know
I don't know what's wrong with you girls
I feel like y'all don't need love, you need somebody who could micromanage you
You know what I'm sayin'? Tell you right from wrong
Who's smart from who's the fool
Which utensil to use for which food, like
I got a schedule to attend to, though
I can't really...
(6ix)

[Verse 1: Drake]
You bitches really get carried away
Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay
Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae
You got my mind in a terrible place
Whipped and chained you like American slaves
Act like you not used to Sheraton stays
I met the nigga you thought could replace
How were there even comparisons made?
Bitch, next time, I swear on my grandmother grave
I'm slimin' you for them kid choices you made

[Refrain: Drake]
Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slimin' you out

Ayy, this ain't the littest I could get on you bitches
Send wires on wires on wires like Idris
You lucky that I don't take back what was given
I could have you on payment plan 'til you're hundred and fifty
And my slime right here, she got some bars for y'all niggas
So I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute

[Refrain: Drake]
Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime

[Verse 3: SZA]
Damn, these niggas got me so twisted
How the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?
I can feel what you're spinnin'
Got too much pride to let no burnt nigga slime me out
Pull up, go write about
My night, got time, let's discuss all those lies about
Frontin' out here like you diggin' me out
And I ain't even cummin', I'm in and out
And you ain't 'bout the shit you rappin' about
And I can spin a ho, I'm airin' it out
I'm goin' off like a sawed-off
You tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'
But with me, you know you doin' all that shit
You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off
But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all
How you niggas get so carried away?
Trippin' when that dick is barely third place
Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame
Dip 'cause it's mid, I can't fake like it's hangin'
[Refrain: SZA]
Slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out
Oh-woah, woah

[Verse 4: Drake]
Yeah
January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly
February is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside
For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
March got you already second guessin' titles
April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral
May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
June have you movin' ice cold, goin' back and forth with a married man
July, that's when I found out you lied
August, it was ""baby"" this, ""baby"" that like you had your tubes tied
September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over
November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single
December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year
Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you
Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news
Get a nigga hit for fifty racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu
Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon
All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom
All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food
Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?
Seven bodyguards just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through
Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths
If I don't pay your rent, it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due
If I don't—

Be grateful

Glory (Yeah)
I'm out here on the road
You can hear it in the voice (Glory)
Still get this shit off, though
Look

[Verse 1]
The money speakin' for itself, I call it fortune-tell
Fire top from a bitch that work at corporate sales
Chinchilla ushanka, we skiin' out in Courchevel
Breakin' news, they tried to kill him, but the boy prevails
I leave for tour and my niggas fuckin' go to jail
Preachin' to the dogs 'bout wantin' more for themselves
It's weighin' heavy on my moral scale
Knowin' they gon' sell another citizen 'caine, they think they Orson Welles
Walk in Chanel, they like, ""How the fuck you need more Chanel?""
I got these cats tuckin' tails on fourth-quarter sales
I'm used to seein' tears drop over enormous meals
The restaurant clears out, faint echoes of Lauryn Hill
I say, ""We gotta talk about us,"" I feel like Jordan Peele
Could tell I'm gettin' under your skin like a orange peel
'Cause your words don't match your actions like a foreign film
And now it's silence in the Lamb' like the horror film
Things get quiet after me statin' the obvious
Things get kinky after fifteen years of dominance
That October sky is lookin' ominous
The money is autonomous
Shout' to Oliver North, he out in Rome doin' Toronto shit
And Jeremiah the watchdog, you niggas know what time it is
I'm in and out of Houston Hobby so much, I'm a hobbyist
Hoes waitin' on Cench in the lobby, that boy a lobbyist
Savage got a green card straight out of the consulate
Where I go, you go, brother, we Yugoslavian
Formal is the dress code, dawg, so many checks owed
I feel Czechoslovakian, nigga, what the fuck?

The numbers goin' up, someone pull up the line graph
The days are goin' by, it's like I'm livin' in time-lapse
Been talkin' to Adel like he majored in finance
Shania Twain, notepad, I'm makin' it line-dance
You tryna rob me, and it's gon' feel like you sittin' at your favorite restaurant 'cause, nigga, that's where you dyin' at
Mob ties, I swear we like a bitch with fine sisters and fine cousins, the family all bad
I'm preachin' to the dawgs about cleanin' they images
I swear I'm like a young T.D. Jakes to my menaces
Long-kiss goodnight, PDA for my nemesis

You young boys take some of that money and set it aside
Not havin' enough to pay your tax is a federal crime
You niggas obsessed with me, and it's not on no hetero vibe
Handle beef so quiet, you think that I'm lettin' it slide
Next thing you know, we tip-toein' past enemy lines
Diss me so long ago, we making your memories fly
Conspiracy theories start floatin' 'round like the Kennedy guy
I'll prolly hold a grudge against you guys 'til I'm seventy-five
Ayy, niggas lyin' for a livin', I couldn't relate
We all gotta lay in the bed we make, but that couldn't be Drake
You forced a lot of fake love when real ones stood in your face
That's why you got deserted by your niggas like puddin' and cake
I got you on camera bowin' down, but the footage is safe
Thank God, another USB to put in the safe
Thank God, at the crib, dippin' my foot in the lake
I swear that y'all turned me into the villain, I couldn't escape
Not sayin' I'm the best at what I do
I'm just sayin' that it's me versus whoever wanna lose
Pick any one of the Who's Whos, I got .22s for new crews

You used to jack the other side, but that shit doesn't phase me

Say you started datin' girls now, say it to me with a straight face
Oh, now it's girls

I wanna touch more money than Brinks

(Baby, you know, you know, you know I need your love)

[Verse 1]
You cannot find no one better than this
Tryna do right by you, but we can't mix, I try
Takin' three months off, then fuckin' again
After you said we not fuckin' again
Never say ""never,"" just say what it is
Act like you need some insurance on it
We didn't get here on accident
Don't make me bring out them racks again
Your two best friends are some savages
Damn, how many days has it been?
Somethin' is different, not genuine
Movin' like Snoopy and Charlie Brown
Feel like you tryna dog the kid

[Bridge]
You're mine
Too many reasons why
I can't picture you with him
That's just so embarrassin'
I want to diе, to die
I swear that I wanted you back thеn
Waitin' on you like a backend
You bad as fuck, ain't no cappin'
Statements you claimed never happened

This can't be the shit that you doin' to me
All of them nights you was slidin' around
Told me what niggas was doin' to you
That's the same shit that you doin' to me
You in the city, you laid up with him
While I'm on the road with no one to see
There's no way
(Baby, you know, you know, you know I need your love)

[Verse 3]
'Cause you cannot find no one better than this
Tryna do right by you, but we can't mix, I try
Fuckin' and argue and fuckin' again
After you said we not fuckin' again
Probably coulda made it work again if I
Was man enough to tell you you was wrong
Man enough to not put it in a song
For the world to sing along
Man enough, I coulda told you on my own
Man enough to admit that
Paragraph I sent last night, yeah, I probably shoulda never sent that
And when you layin' on your stomach, only time I ever wanna get my lick back
How the outsiders know the inside? They was never supposed to get that, nah

[Refrain]
And that's just so embarrassin'
I want to die, to die
[Verse 4]
Ayy, I'm the one that you was wishin' for when you was married
That tale wasn't much of a fairy
Christmas, it wasn't that merry
You a trophy to me like the Larry
Ayy, I'm the one that you was wishin' for
Ayy, I'm the one that you was wishin' for
In Miami and the owls with me like they just put my ass in Gryffindor
Mouth dry over twenty that I never bother gettin' no prescription for
Steez sayin' that you miss me and I won't say it to you, but I miss you more
Said we got each other back and then you put the knife in it like the kitchen drawer
Way I'm feelin' on this album, really took it easy on you, coulda written more
If the shoe was on the other foot and it was me, it woulda been guerilla war
Since you know I got a soft spot for you, this has turned into a civil war
Artists hittin' on you, broke as fuck, I swear them niggas probably live in Singapore
The athlete that you rollin' with, I saw his game last night, he didn't score
Fuck, I gotta say a little more
Show you spots you never been before
It's fucked up that we was goin' once and now you're goin' twice like a biddin' war
Why you act like just 'cause I go to the strip club, girl, that I don't love you?
You still listenin' to R Kelly in the whip, baby girl, and I don't judge you
I'ma end this shit and let the 40 beat play before I snap
In Booby Trap, throwin' more bills than your baby daddy trap

First-person shooter mode, we turnin' your song to a funeral
To them niggas that say they wan' off us, you better be talkin' 'bout workin' in cubicles
Yeah, them boys had it locked, but I knew the code
Lot of niggas debatin' my numeral
Not the three, not the two, I'm the U-N-O

Me and Drizzy, this shit like the Super Bowl
Man, this shit damn near big as the

[Chorus: Drake]
Big as the what? (Ah)
Big as the what? (Mm)

[Verse 1: Drake]
But the difference is it's just two guys playin' shit that they did in the studio
Niggas usually send they verses back to me and they be terrible, just like a two-year-old
I love a dinner with some fine women when they start debatin' about who the G.O.A.T.
I'm like go on 'head, say it then, who the G.O.A.T.?
Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.?

Dissectin' my words and start lookin' too deep
I look at the tweets and start suckin' my teeth
I'm lettin' it rock 'cause I love the mystique
I still wanna get me a song with YB
Can't trust everything that you saw on IG
Just know if I diss you, I'd make sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID
I'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me
Still in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come drop like a father to be
Love when they argue the hardest MC
Is it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?
We the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali
Huh, yeah, yeah, huh-huh, yeah, Muhammad Ali
The one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT
Rhymin' with me is the biggest mistake
The Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake
It's like we recruited your homies to be demon deacons, we got 'em attending your wake
Hate how the game got away from the bars, man, this shit like a prison escape
Everybody steppers, well, fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)
When I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster
The G.O.A.T. with the golden pen, the top toucher
The spot rusher, sprayed his whole shit up, the crop duster
Not Russia, but apply pressure
To your cranium, Cole's automatic when aimin' 'em
With The Boy in the status, a stadium

I click the trigger on the stick like a high beam
Man, I was Bentley wheel whippin' when I was nineteen
She call my number, leave her hangin', she got dry-cleaned
She got a Android, her messages is lime green
I search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings
Nadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine
Man, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines
And they send me naked pictures, it's the small things
You niggas still takin' pictures on a Gulfstream
My youngins richer than you rappers and they all stream
I really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams
Man, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing
Will they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not
They don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot
They know The Boy, the one they gotta boycott
I told Jimmy Jam I use a GRAMMY as a door stop
Girl gave me some head because I need it
And if I fuck with you, then after I might eat it, what?

What the fuck, bro? I'm one away from Michael

She wanna be the one, she know I'm comin' static
She wanna hold the gun, if you want it, you can have it
Shawty still young, so she don't know the classics
I see her body, one-of-one, yeah

Get to the crib, make you cum
Pussy sweet, call you my honeybun (Tss)

Fuck on the crodie, have some fun

Swear you can have me, you really one-of-one (Tss)
How you so nasty? You really one-of-one (Tss)
How you so flashy? You really one-of-one (Tss)

You fucked on a nigga I see as my son, so what?

Had liquor in my cup, had passion in my cup
And Addy in my system, see a opp, I'ma hit 'em up
Yeah, he gon' be a victim, I was tryna dance with the bitch
Couldn't keep my hands off her hips
Know she spent some bands on her fit
Know I told you that she really one-on-one

I gave a fuck 'cause he said the economy was full
It was not full
He said, ""Economy was—""
He said, ""There was no first class, so we're sitting in economy""
I get up on that plane
I see so many seats in first class
Twelve, like, twelve, fourteen seats
Bruh
I sat in the back of the plane
Fucking crazy
And then, I go on that wack-ass vacation
The chef is feeding us the same meal every day like I was, like, in jail still or something
I'm like, ""Why are we eating jerk chicken and oxtail every single day, can we switch it up?""
No, the oxtail was fire though, but can we switch it up?
I can't eat that shit every day, what?
And then you proceed to go through my phone
You wanted to cry
You were lookin' for something

Ayy, what?
It's so, is it real?
Yeah, ayy

[Verse 1]
Give a fuck if they remember
I was in the cold, windows froze, I was sleepin' in the whip tryna get a fucking grip
I remember
Didn't have no hoes tryna go, all these rappers lil' broed me, fuck, fuck
Fuck 'em, I remember
Way before they had a fuckin' DM, I was whippin' in the Ac' like that shit was European
I remember
I remember drivin' Holland Tunnel for a label meetin', thinkin' 'bout more cake than a funnel
I remember
Now these niggas don't remember
I know Neeks remember, I know Jay remember, Chubbs'll make them boys remember
Dead broke, splittin' pennies with my members
Fuck a spread, we was splittin' chicken tenders (I-I-I—)
'Member I was sleepin' in the basement, watchin' Tigger in the basement, I was tryna get a placement
I remember
Days in the East with the bros, watchin' Tristan and Devoe while they runnin' up the score
I remember
TT was headed to the league, I was sleepin' up at Metalworks tryna plant a seed
I remember
Rollin' through the city, gettin' beats, always peepin' out the streets 'cause I was beefin' with the bleeks
I remember
I was tryna get a portion, tryna make a fortune
B-Town with Candy, I'm tryna be her boyfriend
3 AM at Y2, runnin' off endorphins
Start adoptin' all my brothers' beefs like a orphan
I was still on roads when it's pourin' and stormin'
This shit is not rewardin', I do not feel important
I wanna see some scratch from the shit that I'm recordin'
In Memphis smokin' Blacks, tryna act like I enjoy them (I-I-I—)
Maurice François Girbaud what I'm sportin'
And Mos Def gave me like a rack for performin'

You're mine and I'm yours
Like a broke couple we on one accord, for sure

I remember pullin' up at TAO, seein' Quincy Jones, nigga talkin' to me like he proud
I remember
I remember Mike designed the owl, then he sued the fucking guys, and he duckin' until now
I remember (I-I-I—)
'Member Reesie stayin' at the house, then she left me for my dawg like she never took the vow
I remember
My cousin Ryan fronted me a pound and I couldn't even flip it, had to bring it back around
I remember
I remember printin' up our T-shirts with Kai, we in love with the same girl, beefin' like a cow
I would pick them shits up, nigga wouldn't even smile
Nigga better crack a smile 'fore we do a nigga foul
To keep it real, I wasn't really gangster 'til now
I was livin' on a cloud, I was quiet as a mouse
I was in the club gettin' lost in the crowd
Wasn't doin' what I wanted to, I'd do what was allowed
I remember fightin' over Monica with Jason
I remember only knowin' Andre and Jason
I remember buyin' all the iceberg from Jason
That's three different Jasons, my life like The Matrix (I-I-I—)
Even got on 106 & Park with Replacement
My mama was my manager, my uncle was my agent
Dr. Dre'll send a nigga home, that took patience
Four GRAMMY's to my name, a hundred nominations
Esperanza Spalding was gettin' all the praises
I'm tryna keep it humble, I'm tryna keep it gracious
Who give a fuck Michelle Obama put you on her playlist?
Then we never hear from you again like you was taken
Who the CEO of Universal? They mistaken
'Cause Google sayin' Lucian, but that just doesn't make sense
Who fillin' up the piggy bank? Who bringin' home the bacon?
This shit don't come on vinyl, I'm still record-breakin'
How could I forget? How could I forget?
I was on a Greyhound way before the jet
Buffalo, New York was like the furthest I could get
At the Walden Galleria tryna make the money stretch (I-I-I—)
Student Price Card and a Yorkdale connect
Whole time, Courtne Smith was keepin' me in check
Try and find an inch of the city I ain't stepped in
If it's war, I'll lay my life down for the set then

Yeah
And I put that shit on Mazin and that nigga was my best friend
Yeah
And I put that shit on Johnny Bling, that nigga was my best friend

Open up that shit, it's jaw droppin', really shockin', ayy
I ain't pretty flacko, bitch, this shit get really rocky, ayy, what? Damn, what?
Dirty how I did him in the Wraith, what? Say
She actin' Hollywood, this ain't L.A., no way

Yeah, Jason got money that glow in the dark
Hit up the dawg like I'm OVO Mark
Walk-in closet, got more Chrome in than Stark
Forty K a night to sleep at the Mark
Guess it’s time for me to cover the shark
Me and KD 'bout to turn up the art
Fuck you hoes, I swear I'm breakin’ your heart
It's broken
I bought the house just to knock that shit down
I bought the Rolls just to take it apart
She bought an ass, now she makin' it arch
Doctor's office was the last time that you niggas even had your name on a chart
Shawty graduated, playin' it smart (Ayy, yeah)

Used to be a smarty
Used to wanna study, now she poppin' Addies

Forty deep in the East End
We call it swimmin' in the deep end

Them shorties don't listen to Weeknd
They archin' back and makin' knees bend
And they ain't graduate but they geekin'
And they live in a crib with a cheap rent, yeah
And I wish I could dead all the beefin'
And I wish I could dead all the dissin' deceased friends
I wish we could be friends
Probably sound like I'm preachin'
The city might sleep in some peace then
But it's not realistic
What's realistic is money that we spend
We coppin' cars like policemen
We heavy guys like obese men
I keep showin' love to the streets and
It's still free the guys 'til they free men, yeah, yeah

Yeah, grrat
Yeah, damn
I feel like John Wick, empty clips
Yeah, empty clips
Yeah, empty clips

[Verse 1]
Shell cases scatter the floor, bullets, they shatter the glass
I could feel the tension in this room like a chatter in class
Every day breakin' records, shit is just happening fast
That shit was a quick switch, yeah
I feel like I'm always on thin ice with a thick bitch
So many shots fired, I need me a clip switch
I'm in that fuckin' bag right now, I'm a lipstick
Sabbatical in Miami, this shit was holistic
Man, I remember niggas was jokin' 'bout some tick, tick
And now that rapper broke as fuck, the boy a statistic
Empty clips, yeah
Empty clips

[Verse 2]
I'm almost expressionless
John Cena wouldn't know emotions I wrеstle with
Plagued by the fact I was born a pеrfectionist
Still can't even wrap my mind around the success of this
Point me to your boss, nigga, you a receptionist
I really hate the fact I make this shit sound effortless
I put so much thought into the messages
It's borderline obsessiveness, remember who you messin' with
White America say I'm becoming a threat
Black America love to remind me what my mama look like
As if I'd ever fuckin' forget
I'm never enough
Much to their dismay, I'm levelin' up, yeah
There's too much treasure to hunt, there's too many hoes in the spot
The ratio seven to one
Livin' for right now 'cause I really think heaven's a front
Nadia died in Dubai
I waited on a spirit to come by for like seventeen  months
That shit didn't visit me once, damn
She wanted to better her life
She wanted some opportunity, we wasn't given a bunch
Her ex would eat away at her soul, that nigga a munch
The last message she sent to my phone's 'bout keeping in touch
So pardon me questioning God and not believing in much
It's Wick, man, don't listen to Wikipedia
Capo a wicked nigga, I pray it don't hit the media
They say, ""Drake, you gettin' harder,"" funny, it's getting easier
Rappers are slick comedians, and they get disobedient
And they don't stay in they lane, it's like niggas hit the median
Boat say he the recipe, I must be the key ingredient
Capo might wick a man down with evil deviance
They gon' have to talk to Ouija boards like heebie jeebian
Like the large was too big for you, you'll need a medium
Just to send a message to somebody you loved previous

(Conductor)
Yeah, right back
I walked in the studio, Noel said, ""I thought you quit""
I said ""Nah, I'm quittin' again 'cause I started again""
Gotta wait on that
This like the storm before the calm, we'll get to the vacation later
For real
Ayy
Look
Look

[Verse 1]
This is the decompress before the intermission
Done a lot of postgame talkin', but this one different
I told Lee to put him in the car, but don't pistol whip him
And definitely do not shoot his ass 'til you get permission
People got a heavy misread on my disposition
Talkin' loose, then hit me up after on some ""Please, Drake listen, listen""
Energy they bringin' is inconsistent
I got two Virgil Benzes, one that I'm whippin' right now
And the other one, I'm keepin' in mint condition
And niggas bound to slip eventually like they sent permission
Imagine us gettin' our validation from an ex-musician searchin' for recognition
Same story every time, they heckle in repetition
I'm top of the mountain, these niggas still down at base camp, they plannin' they expedition
Y'all the type to catch a charge, head to the deposition
And act like the rapper named after the sex position
But let me tell you 'bout my brother, though
Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though, for real
Let me tell you 'bout my brother
Man, let me tell you 'bout my brother, though
My brother a tool toter, my brother a tombstoner
Diamonds and violence made us bond, we grew closer
Brother a clip loader, my brother a sick soldier
That nigga stick'll it to you for real, he a lint roller
My brother a aim botter, I bought him a Range Rover
My brother a flame thrower
It's like he playin' EDM, that nigga a chain smoker
Niggas want smoke with us, I promise, it's game over
Get your ass twist right here, he a kane roller
And then you niggas whine to J Prince, like some grape growers
Man, what the—?

Yeah
I mean, enough about me (Conductor)
Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'll backhand you boys with my writing hand
You niggas do your shootin' on the web, you Spider-Man
My brother robbin' it down to you junes like Iron Man
My brother make your ace disappear like a slight of hand
My brother carry bundles and extensions like hair stores
It's me, him, and a white ting, we movin' like Paramore
He into some shit that they call internal affairs for
I'm someone he care for, I'm someone he there for
My brother put some holes in your top, you a Air Force
I should charge for interviews, they want me to share more
A ticket just to check in with the boy, like the airport
This the part of the story you wasn't prepared for
Let me tell you 'bout my brother, though
My brother say I'm better than everyone, he biased as fuck
Blood is thicker than water, nigga, his iron is up
And if you keep eyein' me down, trust me, his iron is up
Your last album was buns, you niggas Hawaiian as fuck
Niggas so down bad, they makin' alliances up
Cliquein' up with haters that was thinkin' of signin' to us
Knowin' good and well, that when I drop, they inspired as fuck
Secret admirers too embarrassed, they hide in the cut
CN Towerin' over you niggas, I'm giant as fuck
Wait on whoever to say whatever, they quiet as fuck
The city don't love you like that and they fryin' you up
I can't wait for the day that you choose to retire your stuff
Takin' off the sneakers 'cause you tired of tyin' 'em up
That one day you wake up and tell 'em ""Enough is enough""
That's how you gon' find out you not Kobe Bryant to us
Man, you not Kobe Bryant to us, at all
And if them hoes really love you, then them hoes, they lyin' to us
They say they miss when you got 'em wet and you dryin' them up
Also don't doubt that you sent them here, and they spyin' on us
Man, either way, nigga, beware of the dog, deep in my character flaws (Conductor)
Humble back in 2012, now I give arrogant bars
I remember blue streak with Neeks, we sharin' Lacoste
Now we go for dinner and we joke about sharin' the cost
Got me a ranch in the H, fuck all the carryin' cause
Boy, I'm on top of the cake, just like some caramel sauce
Fuck all the settlin' down, these boys married in-laws

God forbid I take her and they suffer a terrible loss, yeah

Y'all might want to skip this one, this is a
Harsh truth
Very harsh truth
Look

[Chorus]
To all the ladies wonderin' why
Drake can't rap like that same old guy
It's 'cause I don't know how anymore
I don't know how, yeah
I've had my beliefs tested, my faith broken in half
I try to joke and I laugh
But I just don't know how anymore, love
I don't know how, yeah

[Verse 1]
To all the super triggered women talkin' down on me
Relax, drink some water, act like you somebody daughter
Can't get a tan from your phone light
Baby, it's late June, open the blinds, get out The Shade Room
Maybe you could stop gettin' involved in some shit when you not involved
Or maybe you go for a walk somewhere that is not a mall
What's your baby's shoe size? Could tell by the laces, they tight
Or are you only focused on the steps that I'm taking in life?
And then you got the ones who claim a guy that's everyone's nigga
Leave for a month to Colombia and now everything bigger
Even your attitude is bigger, your appetite growing
Your nigga is not even a starting QB
That nigga on the field before the game, he just practicin' throwing
What happened to sellin' real estate? Where all that shit was goin'?
All your fuckin' captions lately talkin' 'bout happy and glowin'
All of that snappin' and posin'
Whole time, he jealous of your past, who the fuck was your last?
Askin' questions 'bout niggas, and you get slapped in the face if you happen to know him
Domestic abuse, that man is not a man for you, he's a pathetic excuse
Lyin' through your teeth, scared of lettin' your skeletons loose
But you stick around, 'cause who's out there that's better for you?
Plus he paid the surgeon so your ass could get a caboose
But he wants you covering it up, so your dresses is loose
Plus it's the only thing they see when you get introduced
Now you on a flight to Bogotá just to get it reduced, good Lord
More weeks of recovery clinics, front like you love every minute
You gettin' pushed to the brink, you sittin' at double your limit
Meanwhile, that nigga out in my city fuckin' on bitches
If they even mention me and showin' me love, then it's finished
Jealous-ass niggas
Damn
Then you got the ones that travel 'cross the globe
Everything is paid, they don't need a man
Don't listen to Drake, never been a fan
You got a million hoes, yeah, I understand
I'm never fuckin' you, so take that out your plans
I'm good on all you niggas 'til a ring is on my hand
Then I search your name, find you on the 'Gram
Click the Linktree and see you suckin' dick on cam, what the fuck?

I just don't know how, yeah

[Verse 2]
To all the ladies on my case with a look on they face
Allow me to put these bums right back in they place
For all the niggas who act twelve
The fake gangsters with a MAC-12
The ones that only hit your phone up when it's past twelve
Baddies not the only ones worried 'bout strikin' a pose
You orderin' one bottle to split between five of the bros
All your boos think it's Halloween and they went ghost
That's when you go Miami on the 'Gram and you rent boats
And now they thinkin' you sweet with the bread like French toast
You boys becomin' detectives, but ain't in no trench coats
I would never guess that you niggas is this crazy
She took dick in Ibiza, you turn into Dick Tracy
You niggas so jaded
Actin' Hulk tough, but you only turn green because your necklace is gold-plated
She settled for an NBA star that's through playin'
Instead, she got an NBA fan that's 2K-in'
She lookin' for high ground, hate bein' tied down
She loved you for the first year, but those feelings died down
She livin' in downtown, you live with your parents still
You don't own a steering wheel, so you can't even drive down
You downloaded the My Mercedes app for some time now
To track when she ride 'round
You know where she goin' before she there, it raise eyebrows
You hackin' her iCloud, you committing cyber crimes
You niggas is out of line
She's finally movin' on, she's only said it a thousand times
You sold her a dream, talkin' that give you the world shit
Her friends wanna get her back on that diamonds and pearl shit
I mean, it was girls there, but it wasn't a girls trip
She met a guy
She met a guy that ain't just gettin' by, a better guy
She 'bout to spread her wings and you just gotta let her fly
You know you can't control a Gemini, that's facts
She like, ""Shh, quiet, everybody, the game started
My new boo hoopin' tonight and he said he play at the Garden
He said if I ain't watching, then that nigga ain't startin'""
She point to the guy that she talkin' 'bout and it's James Harden
[Interlude]
Damn, dog
Lost your, lost your girl to The Sniper, huh?
13, good God
I feel for you, bro
Look

[Chorus]
So, to all the ladies wonderin' why
Drake can't rap like that same old guy
It's 'cause I don't know how anymore

[Verse]
The most decorated, competition decimated
My drive is dedicated, your drive is designated
Niggas got you to the spot and then you separated
Reasons for it speculated, we know how it escalated
Rarely celebrated, grade eleven educated
Radio is king again, Billboard got me regulated
Wanna makе it fair for you, numbers that I generatеd
Do right and kill everything, people knew that death awaited
Taylor Swift the only nigga that I ever rated
Only one could make me drop the album just a little later
Rest of y'all, I treat you like you never made it
Leave your label devastated
Even when you pad the stats, period, I never hated
Even when you stab me in the back, the vest is metal-plated
Tryna see a B inside my circle like I'm gettin' graded
Man, all this luggage in the lobby like I'm gettin' traded
Every time you need me for a boost, I never hesitated
Every time that Yeezy called a truce, he had my head inflated
Thinkin' we gon' finally peace it up and get to levitatin'
Realize that everything premeditated
Everyone was good with me, then everyone expression faded
Tickin' time bomb and they beggin' me to detonate it
If I press this red button, dog, everybody Heaven Gated
Press this red button, dog, and everything forever changes
Word to M-Dolla, she the only one could maybe save it
Should've hit you first, but, sis, you know about the shit I've taken
Niggas think it's sweet, but I am not a diabetic patient
No
I will start blackin' over here like it's segregation
I will fuckin' double-cross you niggas like it's meditation
I'll give you a hard pill to swallow, this your medication
I will fuckin' pop up on your ass like a revelation
I could tell you better than I show you, this a demonstration
I will fuckin' leave you in the dirt like some vegetation
Chemicals is mixin' in my brain and killin' hesitation
I will fuckin' force a few shots like a vaccination
Niggas fuckin' call me up to cap, this not a graduation
I will fuckin' put your ass on pause like I'm Pastor Mason
I will set alarms off and cause a whole evacuation
I'll fuckin'—, I'll fuckin'—
I'll get to you ten years from now like procrastination
I'll fuckin' find out wherever y'all are celebratin'
Pull up, park my Phantom on the curb like I'm Larry David

Yeah (Oh, baby, be honest with yourself)
Yeah
Everything good, everything pure (There's some things in life and you know)
(Ooh, ways, if you wanna keep that guy)
Everything pure
(You've got to change your evil ways, if you wanna keep that—)

[Verse: Drake & J. Cole]
Yeah, I got some evil ways
Even through the glasses, you could see the gaze
To find your way up to the top, this shit gon' be a maze
Volkswagen shit the way I'm runnin' Beatles plays
Yeah, and we linkin' like we freed the slaves
I conquered hell, I walkеd the 'Ville and set my feet ablazе
My heart hardens every year like sneakers that Adidas made
I never did the VMAs, I'm not in need of praise
All praise to the born sinners Jesus saves
My brothers runnin' through the 6ix like the Green Berets
Beefin' with a block that's five hundred feet away
Wheel of Fortune shit the way they say they need a K
Nah, uh, I only need a raise
And a safe to stash these Frito Lays
Times was hard, I watched my mama robbin' Paul just to get Peter paid
And now my paper folded like when teachers don't want classmates to see your grade
Time is speedin' now, I see the greys pokin' out this beard, but it's weird 'cause I feel like I ain't even age (Yeah)
Y'all seize the rage, feet firmly planted for these precious flowers I've been handed, watch me be the vase
Man, I'm livin' out Carlito's way
You niggas ain't gettin' no bread, you in a keto phase
Wisdom comin' out my mouth like some teethin' pain
My whip used to have the seat displays where S.M.A.C.K. DVD would play
Zopiclone baby, I can't rest without the sleepin' aids
Bought this nigga jewels, these shits is light, let's get it reappraised
I bet you see the price and you gon' be amazed
And broski didn't do it, he like a piece of art, judge, he was framed
Some feed the J's to receive a wage
Coke got they nose bleedin' like the seats where you can't see the stage
High up in arenas where they see their faves
AKA me and Drizzy Drake, we the wave
Uh, yeah, we the wave
Like Christian Combs with a brush in his hand once the grease is laid
Shit is 360 like the label deal you signed to get your people paid
Me, I got tickets like a meter maid
And 21 my nigga like he celebratin' legal age
Next time I get in ROSALÍA face
I hope she tell her people that we need some space
Niggas think I won't get 'em hit, but like an Indian marriage, it could be arranged
Diss me and just may see us on your block like the street parade
At the top playin' keep-away with the crown
Our life's an open book, come and read a page
Drake pulled a white bitch that's goin' both ways, she like the queen of spades
I'm startin' to think they Percs is fake, they weed is laced
For thinkin' it's a game, if it's a game, these streets would be Bushido's Blade
Razor to his face and he ain't need a shave
I stay out of beef, seen niggas' DNA get rearranged
I'm with Drizzy in Atlanta, so many hitters with that nigga, they could be the Braves
Young angel goin' through his demon phase
Hard to blame 'em, Lord knows this game can be depraved
Scary Hours undefeated, y'all should be afraid
Yeah, y'all should be afraid

Guess I got the mind of a little man

Then she tell a story, this shit kinda bitter man
This is a nut [?], about how you did it man
You never hit, so you feel like a silly man
She never mention the spot that you fillin' in
She keep on tellin' your friends, your head in a spin
You can't even win, your head in a dance
She won't let it in, you spend it on her, she spend it on him
You see a check, then you see a grand
As soon as you speak, I pace as [?]
A face in the sand, a face [?] her man
And ya'll take your pictures, save it a chance
She call you a name, you scratchin' your chin
Like who is this nigga man, who is a [?]
You finally get it, you catchin' ahead
Suckin' your head, I'm far out the wing
And she tried to vent 'bout she wasn't in
How she really good, how she ain't a pimp
Then you take her back, she do it again

Ayy

[Verse 1]
I could never be nobody number-one fan
Your first number one, I had to put it in your hand
You pussies can't get booked outside America for nan'
I'm out in Tokyo because I'm big in Japan
I'm the hitmaker y'all depend on
Backstage in my city, it was friendzone
You won't ever take no chain off of us
How the fuck you big steppin' with a size-seven men's on?
This the bark with the bite, nigga, what's up?
I know my picture on the wall when y'all cook up
Extortion baby, whole career, you been shook up
'Cause Top told you, ""Drop and give me fifty,"" like some push-ups, huh
Your last one bricked, you really not on shit
They make excuses for you 'cause they hate to see me lit
Pull your contract 'cause we gotta see the split
The way you doin' splits, bitch, your pants might rip
You better do that motherfuckin' show inside the bity
Maroon 5 need a verse, you better make it witty
Then we need a verse for the Swifties
Top say drop, you better drop and give 'em fifty
Pipsqueak, pipe down
You ain't in no big three, SZA got you wiped down
Travis got you wiped down, Savage got you wiped down
Like your label, boy, you in a scope right now
And you gon' feel the aftermath of what I write down
I'm at the top of the mountain, so you tight now
Just to have this talk with your ass, I had to hike down
Big difference 'tween Mike then and Mike now
What the fuck is this, a twenty-v-one, nigga?
What's a prince to a king? He a son, nigga
Get more love in the city that you from, nigga
Metro, shut your ho ass up and make some drums, nigga
Yeah, I'm the 6ix God, I'm the frontrunner
Y'all nigga manager was Chubbs lil' blunt runner
Claim the 6ix and you boys ain't even come from it
And when you boys got rich, you had to run from it
Cash blowin' Abel bread, out here trickin' (Out here trickin')
Shit we do for bitches, he doin' for niggas (What the fuck?)
Jets, whips, chains, wicked, wicked, wicked (Wicked, wicked)
Spend it like you tryna fuck, boy, you trippin', boy, you trippin'
Drizzy Chip 'n Dale, probably got your bitch Chanel
I just got 'em done, boy, don't make me have to chip a nail
Rolling Loud stage, y'all were turnt, that was slick as hell
Shit'll probably change if your BM start to kiss and tell
Hugs and kisses, man, don't tell me 'bout no switches
I'll be rockin' every fuckin' chain I own next visit, ayy
I be with some bodyguards like Whitney
Top say drop, your little midget ass better fuckin'

[Verse 2]
I might take your latest girl and cuff her like I'm Ricky
Can't believe he jumpin' in, this nigga turnin' fifty
Every song that made it on the chart, he got from Drizzy
Spend that lil' check you got and stay up out my business
Nigga, shout out to the hooper that be bustin' out the griddy
We know why you mad, nigga, I ain't even trippin'
All that lil' heartbroken Twitter shit for bitches
This for all the top dogs, drop and give me fifty, drop, drop
And that fuckin' song y'all got did not start the beef with us
This shit been brewin' in a pot, now I'm heatin' up
I don't care what Cole think, that Dot shit was weak as fuck
Champagne trippin', he is not fuckin' easin' up
Nigga callin' Top to see if Top wanna peace it up
""Top, wanna peace it up? Top, wanna peace it up?""
Nah, pussy, now you on your own when you speakin' up
You done rolled deep to this, it's not fuckin' deep enough
Beggin' Kai Cenat, boy, you not fuckin' beatin' us
Numbers-wise, I'm out of here, you not fuckin' creepin' up
Money-wise, I'm out of here, you not fuckin' sneakin' up

Killuminati
Dons rise again
You can see it in my eyes again

[Verse 1: 2Pac (AI)]
Kendrick, we need ya, the West Coast savior
Engraving your name in some hip-hop history
If you deal with this viciously
You seem a little nervous about all the publicity
Fuck this Canadian lightskin, Dot
We need a no-debated West Coast victory, man
Call him a bitch for me
Talk about him likin' young girls, that's a gift from me
Heard it on the Budden Podcast, it's gotta be true
They told me the spirit of Makaveli is alive
In a nigga under 5'5"", so it's gotta be you
I would beef the whole fuckin' game
It was me and Snoop Dogg, had my fuckin' shirt off in the House of Blues
K, you gotta fuck this nigga girl, he gotta get abused
All that shit 'bout burning tattoos, he is not amused
That's jail talk for real thugs, you gotta be you
Gotta leave this motherfucker broken and bruised before we really lose
You asked for the smoke, now it seem you too busy for the smoke
I won't lie, the people confused
Now you 'bout to give this shit another week?
And fall back so homegirl can run her numbers up? I woulda refused
Fuck these industry relationships, she not in your shoes
You supposed to be the boogeyman, go do what you do
Unless this is a moment that you tell us this not really you
In that case, there's nothing left to say, I'll just pass it to Snoop

Nephew, what the fuck you really 'bout to do?
We passed you the torch at the House of Blues
And now you gotta do some dirty work, you know how to move, right? Right?
I know you never been to jail, orange jumpsuits and shower shoes
Never shot nobody, never stabbed nobody
Never did nothing violent to no one, it's the homies that empower you
But still, you gotta show this fuckin' owl who's boss on the West
Now's a time to really make a power move
'Cause right now it's looking like you writin' out the game plan on how to lose
How to bark up the wrong tree and then get your head popped in a crowded room
World is watching this chess game, but are you out of moves?
Dot, you know that the D-O-G never fuckin' doubted you
But right now it seem like you posted up without a clue
Of what the fuck you 'bout to do

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, unc', that's the truth
I'm definitely 'bout to come around the Lang gang and let my fuckin' bowel move
Shittin' on you niggas from a whole different altitude
High up in the sky like I'm Howard Hughes
The first one really only took me an hour or two
The next one is really 'bout to bring out the coward in you
But now we gotta wait a fuckin' week 'cause Taylor Swift is your new Top
And if you 'bout to drop, she gotta approve
This girl really 'bout to make you act like you not in a feud
She tailor-made your schedule with Ant, you out of the loop
Hate all you corporate industry puppets, I'm not in the mood
I love it when you niggas talk loose like I'm not in the room
Since ""Like That,"" your tone changed a little, you not as enthused
How are you not in the booth? It feel like you kinda removed
You tryna let this shit die down, nah, nah, nah
Not this time, nigga, you followin' through
I guess you need another week to figure out how to improve
What the fuck is taking so long? We waitin' on you
The rest of y'all are definitely involved, y'all gettin' it too
Soon as you get the courage to drop, I'm out on the loose, on the loose
[Outro: Drake]
Yeah, shout out to Taylor Swift
Biggest gangster in the music game right now
You know, I moved my album when she dropped, I said that already
You know, she 'bout to milli' run through a Milly Rock on your head top, well
She got the whole pgLang on mute like that Beyoncé challenge, y'all boys quiet for the weekend, like
Dot, I know you're in that NY apartment, you strugglin' right now, I know it
In the notepad doing lyrical gymnastics, my boy
You better have a motherfuckin' quintuple entendre on that shit
Some shit I don't even understand, like
That shit better be crazy, we waitin' on you

You mentioned my seed, now deal with his dad
I gotta go bad, I gotta go bad

If you had a set, they'd give your ass a DP
But you civilian gang, in real life, you PC
You know who really bang a set? My nigga YG
You know who really bang a set? My nigga Chuck T
You know who even bang a set out there is CB
And, nigga, Cole losin' sleep on this, it ain't me
You better have some paperwork or that shit fakе tea
Can't be rappin' 'bout no rattin' that we can't rеad
I mean it's true a nigga slimed me for my AP
Just like how Metro nigga slimed him for his main squeeze
Out here beggin' for attention, nigga, say please
Always rappin' like you 'bout to get the slaves freed
You just actin' like an activist, it's make-believe
Don't even go back to your hood and plant no money trees
Say you hate the girls I fuck, but what you really mean?
I been with Black and white and everything that's in between
You the Black messiah wifin' up a mixed queen
And hit vanilla cream to help out with your self-esteem
On some Bobby shit, I wanna know what Whitney need
All that puppy love was over in y'all late teens
Why you never hold your son and tell him, ""Say cheese?""
We could've left the kids out of this, don't blame me
You a dog and you know it, you just play sweet
Your baby mama captions always screamin', ""Save me""
You did her dirty all your life, you tryna make peace
I heard that one of 'em little kids might be Dave Free
Don't make it Dave Free's
'Cause if your GM is your BM secret BD
Then this is all makin' plenty fuckin' sense to me
Ayy, let that shorty breathe
Shake that ass, bitch, hands on your knees
Hands on your knees, hands on your knees
Shake that ass for Drake, now shake that ass for free
Yeah, yeah
Well, not that kind of free, I'm talkin' 'bout my nigga Dave
Your man a lil' K, we call that shit a mini Drac'
He always said I overlooked him, I was starin' straight
These bars go over Kenny head no matter what I say

Still mad about that one ho, we ain't even fuck, I just lip-locked with her
I get active when it's war time, I ain't even really let my dick drop, nigga
What the fuck I heard Rick drop, nigga? Talkin' somethin' 'bout a nose job, nigga
Ozempic got a side effect of jealousy and doctor never told y'all niggas
Put a nigga in the bars, let a nigga rot, kind of like your old job, nigga
House sittin' on some land, but it's out where no one even really know y'all niggas
Bitches gotta drive two hours 'fore you pay 'em just to give a blowjob, nigga
Must've snorted up a snowball
'Cause my last record deal was four hundred M's, these days, that's a low ball, nigga
Ayy
Who's next on the list?
Which one of my so-called niggas
Which one of my so-called niggas
Which one of my so-called niggas need a shell from the clip?
Always knew I had to smoke y'all niggas
​good kid, m.A.A.d city van, we'll pop the latch and let the door slide
Tears runnin' down my cheek, laughin' at you pussies dyin', it's a war cry
Weeknd music gettin' played in all the spots where boys got a little more pride
That's why all your friends dippin' to Atlanta, payin' just to find a tour guide
Abel, run your fuckin' bread, need to buy some more chains for some more guys
Let me find another street nigga I can take to the game courtside
Let me get a used Ferrari for a rapper, take the nigga on a horse ride
Anything to take the spotlight off the fact the boss is a drugged-out lil' punk sissy from the Northside
Rakim talkin' shit again
Gassed 'cause you hit my BM first, nigga, do the math, who I was hittin' then?
I ain't even know you rapped still 'cause they only talkin' 'bout your 'fit again
Probably gotta have a kid again 'fore you think of droppin' any shit again
Even when you do drop, they gon' say you should've modeled 'cause it's mid again
Smokin' Fenty 'bout it, should've put you on the first one, tryna get it in
Ask Fring if this a good idea the next time you cuddled in that bed again
She'll even tell you leave the boy alone 'fore you get your head split again
Pluto shit make me sick to my stomach, we ain't never really been through it
Leland Wayne, he a fuckin' lame, so I know he had to be an influence
These niggas had a plan and they finally found a way to rope you into it
Two separate albums dissin', I just did a Kim to it, nigga, skim through it
Me and Savage had the hoes drippin' wet at shows, almost had to swim to it
K-Dot shit is only hittin' hard when Baby Keem put his pen to it
Ross callin' me the white boy and the shit kind of got a ring to it
'Cause all these rappers wavin' white flags while the whole fuckin' club sing to it
Murder scene on your man tonight, then come to the vigil with the candlelight
Body after fuckin' body and you know Rick readin' my Miranda rights
I'm goin' on vacation now, hope next time, y'all plan it right
'Cause you gotta pay for sayin' my name, guess now niggas understand the price

You wanna take up for Pharrell? Then come get his legacy out of my house
A cease and desist is for hoes, can't listen to lies that come out of your mouth
You called the Tupac estate and begged 'em to sue me and get that shit down
I'm losin' perspective on beef, Boi-1da send beat and I'll kill you for fun

Anthony set up the plays, Kojo be chargin' you double for nothin'
They shook about what I'ma say, but textin' your phone like, ""We already won""
You tell me what I shouldn't say, but fuck it, my nigga, it's already done
We already know it's a twenty-v-one, we already know why you went number one
It's clearly because of The Boy, the honorable thing is to give me the loot
You right about ""Fuck the big three,"" it's only Big D, and there's video proof
Our sons should go play at the park, two lightskin kids, that shit would be cute
Unless you don't want to be seen with anyone that isn't Blacker than you
We get it, we got it
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
We get that you like to put gin in your juice
We get that you think that you Bishop in Juice
When you put your hands on your girl, is it self-defense 'cause she bigger than you?
Your back is up against the curb, you diggin' for dirt, should be diggin' for proof
Why did you move to New York? Is it 'cause you livin' that bachelor life?
Proposed in 2015, but don't wanna make her your actual wife
I'm guessin' this wedding ain't happenin', right?
'Cause we know the girls that you actually like
Your darkest secrets are comin' to light
It's all on your face like what happened to Mike
Oh shit, it's all makin' sense, maybe I'm Prince and you actually Mike
Michael was prayin' his features would change so people believe that he's actually white
Top would make you do features for change, get on pop records and rap for the whites
And wait, you say your brother Jermaine, but you wanted him to stay out of the light
Oh shit, just follow me, right? 'Cause nothin' you sayin' could bother me, right?
I get off the plane and nothing has changed, I head to Delilah with all of my ice
Head to Delilah with all of my ice, head to Delilah with all of my ice
This shit gotta be over by now for anyone out here that's calling it, right?
You're dead
You're dead, you're dead
There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to hide, you know what I mean
They hired a crisis management team to clean up the fact that you beat on your queen
The picture you painted ain't what it seem, you're dead34Embed"

If you were in a pine box, box
I would shovel dirt on top, top
I'd play this record on repeat, 'peat
You always been a bitch to me
If you was in a pine box, box
I would still be in my spot, spot
For you to make it to the peak, peak
It'd have to be the death of me, the death of me

[Verse]
Lookin' in the mirror, still embarrassed
Stop talkin' how you gon' spare us
React like an infant whenever I am mentioned
It's like you need tension to always get attention
You always said how you wanna bury me alive
Jealousy disguised as yo' muhfuckin' pridе
Took you on your first tour with us, tryna catch a vibe
I was headline, you was standin' on thе side
Brought you and that other hoe along for the ride
First time people lined up for your ass
Now you sayin' two pussy boys gettin' outta line
You been hatin' hard for a very long time
It feel like Twitter ghostwritin’ your reply
Streets out here talkin' like, ""At least a nigga tried""
It's how you felt in 2011, why we wastin' time?
Dreams come true, crodie, this is where you dieYou might also like1Embed"

Now let me see ya prove it
Just let me see ya prove it

[Verse]
Alright
The Pulitzer Prize winner is definitely spiralin'
I got your fucking lines tapped, I swear that I'm dialed in
First, I was a rat, so where's the proof of the trial then?
Where's the paperwork or the cabinet it's filed in?
1090 Jake would've took all the walls down
The streets would've had me hidin' out in a small town
My Montreal connects stand up, not fall down
The ones that you're gettin' your stories from, they all clowns
I am a war gеneral, seasoned in prеparation
My jacket is covered in medals, honor and decoration
You waited for this moment, overcome with the desperation
We plotted for a week and then we fed you the information
A daughter that's eleven years old, I bet he takes it
We thought about giving a fake name or a destination
But you so thirsty, you not concerned with investigation
Instead you in Advantage Studio, it's a celebration
You gotta learn to fact check things and be less impatient
Your fans are rejoicin', thinkin' this is my expiration
Even the picture you used, the jokes and the medication
The Maybach glove and the drug he uses for less inflation
Master manipulator, you bit on the speculation
You dumb and reactive, nigga, I'm petty with dedication
What about the bones we dug up in that excavation?
And why isn't Whitney denyin' all of the allegations?
Why is she following Dave Free and not Mr. Morale?
You haven't seen the kids in six months, the distance is wild
Dave leaving heart emojis underneath pics of the child
Speakin' of anything with a child, let's get to that now
This Epstein angle was the shit I expected
TikTok videos you collected and dissected
Instead of being on some diss-direct shit
You rather fucking grab your pen and misdirect shit
My mom came over today and I was like, ""Mother, I—, mother, I—, mother—""
Ahh, wait a second, that's that one record where you say you got molested
Aw, fuck me, I just made the whole connection
This about to get so depressin'
This is trauma from your own confessions
This when your father leave you home alone with no protection, so neglected
That's why these pedophile raps is shit you so obsessed with, it's so excessive
They acting like it's so aggressive
But you just never known affection
I don't wanna diss you anymore, this really got me second guessing
""Touch My Body"" by Mariah Carey play, you probably start reflectin'
I never been with no one underage, but now I understand why this the angle that you really mess with
Just for clarity, I feel disgusted, I'm too respected
If I was fucking young girls, I promise I'd have been arrested
I'm way too famous for this shit you just suggested
But that's not the lesson, clearly there's a deeper message
Deep cuts that never healed and now they got infected
Like if Dave really fucked your girl and got her pregnant, talk about breedin' resentment
I'm not sure how to ease the sentiment, this shit's too intimate
I'm praying you recover from both incidents
But you a piece of shit, so this shit really no coincidence
Drake is not a name that you gon' see on no sex offender list, Eazy-Duz-It
You mentionin' A minor, but niggas gotta B sharp and tell the fans, ""Who was it?""
You thought you left D flat, D major
I'll slit your throat with the razor and do Rick Ross Air like that one flight from Malaysia, I'm your baby mama's screen saver
Only fuckin' with Whitneys, not Millie Bobby Browns, I'd never look twice at no teenager
I'm a fucking hitmaker, dog, not a peacemaker
Yeah, bullets that I'm stuffin' in each chamber, your ass in extreme danger
Stop buyin' views and bot comments, you may as well keep the paper
Shit you 'bout to need for later
I give a fuck about your streamin' data
You could drop a hundred more records, I'll see you later
Yeah, maybe when you meet your maker
I don't wanna fight with a woman beater, it feeds your nature
If you still bumping R. Kelly, you could thank the Savior
Said if they deleted his music then your music is going too, a hypocrite
I don't understand why these people praise you, soundin' like you send him commissary when he need some paper
Album droppin' soon, no wonder you turn to a clout chaser 'stead of doing hard labor
Nigga, I'll see you when I see you like Fantasia
And Whitney, you can hit me if you need a favor
And when I say I hit ya back, it's a lot safer
Huh, I promise
You might also like[Outro]
Yeah
I'm not gonna lie this shit was some, some good exercise, like
It's good to get out, get the pen workin'
You would be a worthy competitor if I was really a predator and you weren't fuckin' lying to every blogger and editor, but
It is what it is
You definitely got this shit burnt the fuck out though, like
You got ten more records to drop
The one before the last one, we finessed you into telling a story that doesn't even exist
And then, you go and drop the West Coast one to try and cover that up
I would like that one, that w-, that, that would be some shit I could dance to if you wasn't triplin' down on some whole other bullshit, but
You know, at least your fans are gettin' some raps out of you
I'm happy I could motivate you
Bring you back to the game, like
You know, but
Just let me know when we're gettin' to the facts
Everything in my shit is facts
I'm waitin' on you to return the favor, like7Embed"
