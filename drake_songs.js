What up, Slum Ville?\nI hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still\nThe fans thinking that we all signed for one mil\nEqual opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal\nThat ain't how it works, that ain't how it goes\nAnd I been getting high just to balance out the lows\nAnd I could use a writer just to balance out my flows\nBut I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows\nAnd every time I try, it opens up my eyes\nThese verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised\nAnd I would be performing this as long as I'm alive\nSo every word I utter will be mine\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes\nPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nI remember you, this feeling isn't new\nSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\n(Don't take this the wrong way but, uh)\nI never cried when Pac died\nBut I probably will when Hov does\nAnd if my tears hold value then I would drop one\nFor every single thing he showed us\nAnd I'll be standing in a puddle\nI stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble\nAnd I'ma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle\nIt's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle\nStaring at the members of my team\nWho get questioned 'bout they profit from this million dollar scheme\nJust know that I'm in debt for you defending all our dreams\nI hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems\nBut y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion\nYou know I spend money because spending time is hopeless\nAnd know I pop bottles 'cause I bottle my emotions\nAt least I put it all in the open\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes\nPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nI remember you, this feeling isn't new\nSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\n\n[Verse 3]\nLook, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here\nPremature millionaires, welcome to my realest year\nYeah, I swear that we making a killing here\nI should be on top of the world just chilling here\nUh, but it's funny having fans\nWho find you before anybody ever has the chance\nAnd build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game\nAnd realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same\nYeah, and plus things are just surreal at home\nPeople think I've changed just 'cause my appeal has grown\nAnd now security follow me everywhere\nSo I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone\nI think I'm scared of what the future holds\nI was wishing for some things and now I'm used to those\nEvery girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes\nThe honesty of my music has left me too exposed\nAll my old friends think I got a new crowd\nAnd people seem to notice every time I do smile\nI guess that mean they come few and far between\nEven though I'm living out what you would call the dream\nYeah, and my uncle ain't even messaging me\nAnd him missing in my life is kind of messing with me\nI hope this isn't one of those forever things\nIt's funny how money can change everything\n[Chorus]\nDon't believe the lies, look me in my eyes\nPlease don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me\nI remember you, this feeling isn't new\nSo please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me40Embed"

Who better for you than the boy, huh?\nYou might also like[Chorus: Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n[Verse 3: Drake]\nUh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures\nOr further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage\nWhen I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit\nA weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it\n'Cause that night I played her three songs\nThen we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on\nThen she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz\nBoy, was she wrong\nThat was just negative energy for me to feed off\nNow it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria\nOr Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria\nLandmarks of the muses that inspired the music\nWhen I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it\nThe one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree\nI've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me\nNow she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?\nKnow we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?\nRemember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz\nGirl, I felt like we had it all planned out\nI guess I fucked up the vision\nLearning the true consequences of my selfish decisions\nWhen you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven\nIt seem like you don't want this love anymore\nI'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore\nBut girl, what qualities was I looking for before?\nWho you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?\n[Chorus: Jhen\u00e9 Aiko]\nI love me\nI love me enough for the both of us\nThat's why you trust me\nI know you been through more than most of us\nSo what are you\nWhat are you, what are you so afraid of?\nDarling, you\nYou give, but you cannot take love\n\n[Outro: Baka Not Nice]\nBeen Baka aka Not Nice from time, G\nBeen a East Side ting\nScarborough ting from time, G\nBeen have up di ting dem from time, G\nSo I don't know what's wrong with these\nLittle wasteman out here, eh?\nY'all need to know yourself576Embed"

Pittsburgh Steelers\nDrake, you got it\nRobert Kraft sent the jet for us, that shit was patriotic\nYou would think we live in Baltimore, the way they ravin' 'bout the latest product\nTeachin' niggas how to mind they business, and my latest stuff\nMight be the only teacher that gets paid enough\nThat's why I'm in Hyde Park buyin' like half of Harrods\nYou niggas are too concerned with makin' sure y'all outfits gon' match in Paris\nIf we don't like you, you payin' tax and tariffs\nCome to the 6 and I'm like the actin' sheriff, deputy\nFirst got to America, niggas wouldn't check for me\nNo chance the kid'll make it here like vasectomy\nThey underestimated my trajectory\nBut now they gotta pay that shit direct to me\nI send the label bills, bills, bills like the other two women standing next to Bey, that shit was just\u2014\nIndependent women is lovin' the new appearance\nMatter of time before I go net a Bey like a Paris\nLike, \"Honey, you gotta know that I never wore Mike Amiris or never hopped in a Urus\"\nI got my head in the clouds, I'm serious\nThe lyrics begin to reveal themselves over time periods\nPromise you'll get that shit when the sky clears\nThis shit designed for divine ears\nMy favorite two words from you white boys is, \"Sign here\"\nAnd then comes the sound of glass clinkin' from a wine cheers\nSwear I'm pocket checkin' y'all for five years\nAnd then we

spooky\nI swear you don't even mean what y'all say like y'all dubbin' a movie\nSidebar, Serena, your husband a groupie\nHe claim we don't got a problem but\nNo, boo, it is like you comin' for

a roll like hamachi\nThe fuck would y'all really do without me?\nFor your birthday, your man got a table at Hibachi\nLast time I ate there, Wayne was doin' numbers off the cup like Yahtzee\nAnd Paris Hilton was steady duckin' the paparazzi\nQuavo might've sent me a song that he called \"Versace\"\nI really can't remember it properly\nAll I know is that God got me, I'm sittin' on large
