Dot's in my colon\nThat nigga, Colon Powell\nModern day war victim\nOh, I'm foul, come join my coalition\nNo snitch nigga, go join the co-defendant\nFeel relentless, new apprentice\nKing of, comprehension\nNo competition\nCompton's back, pump your fist like this and that\nNo sumbliminals, I'm listenin', face the facts\nYou're a disgrace to this rap business\nJust a one-man office, you need assistance\nGun tucked, walk in the club, set off sensors\nI am a senseless thug, with book smarts\nAnd anybody wanna go at rap legends, without theirself to question\nWe gave you the self-motivation to be in this profession\nGave you the rhyme scheme before your English education\nExclamation, put it in quotes\nI say I'm better than most that say they're the ones that gave 'em swag\nThe flow, the artist development\nAm I who gave you the growth?\nYou didn't bloom by yourself, somebody had to plant the seed\nThe sun shine, and now king me\nThe rapper's rapper, the MC's MC\nKodak moment that's been captured, cheese\nI said cheeseYou might also likeEmbed"

Dot from Compton\nMan Hootie probably was the youngest out that was poppin'\nBut I didn't have a home yet, Hootie had ? in me\nUntil I met Top Dawg, told Dave that he'd like to meet\nMe at the studio, made me freestyle for an hour\nTold me come back tomorrow, but I came back in a hour\nJay Rock was in the booth, recording his first mixtape\nWas skeptical homie at first because he knew where I stayed\nBut we got over that, heard the beat, wrote a rap\nDid our first collaboration on the Nephew track\nHe got signed months later, Warner Brothers\nWe started on his album, he wrote his rhymes on paper\nBefore Sidekicks became a modern day phone\nSame time our buzz was generated from G Malone\nHe had a song called 200, White Lightnin, the streets loved it\nSaid that Sony had gave him an unbelievable budget\nNow that's a smart nigga, I'm tryna make my raps bigger than life\nBut not knowing how to market it right\nTurned on the radio\nOnly cat new from the West Coast was playin' was Bishop\nAnd by then this nigga' buzz was tremendous\nIn the lab, me and Rock tryna perfect our craft\nWhat the fuck? Next thing you know, we came across Lift Me Up\nIt was a hit\nWhen I heard it\nBut all we had was the instrumental and the hook\nBut when\nRock jump on it for certain, it was to smash\nGave it to Julio, just to get his opinion\nNext thing you know, the record was\nSpinning\nThat was a good look, it set the coast on fire\nNiggas in Garden projects presents Watts Riot\nThen these rappers start hating, callin' up to the station\nAsk why they record ain't playin', what you niggas complaining, about?\nShit was funny to us tho\nNiggas hate to see a nigga from the bottom come up, yo\nIn the midst of the single poppin' and niggas tryna seek and destroy\nI had a situation with Def Jam, premature\nShit went sour after Jay-Z left but they didn't care\nI was glad Jay-Z gave me respect\nSee I was young, fast forward, hot dollah had the streets on lock\nFar as radio play, obvious, he got a lot\nBeefing\u2019 with Daz Dilinger, Jay Rock spoke on it\nWhich in my opinion, I didn\u2019t think the shit was impo\u2019tant\nBut that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother story, we hit the lab with Game\nAnd a few other names like Juice and Young, ya boy\nDid the cypher freestyle and everybody\u2019s like, \"Wow\"\nThese Top Dawg niggas \u2018bout to make noise\"\nSurely after Game took us on tour, I love you for that\nBut right after that, we didn\u2019t see him no more\nG Malone came with a smash hit with Akon\nMistah FAB battled Royce Nickel with napalm\nThen everybody start to scream out the new West\nAnd claim that West Coast legends don\u2019t want to see him at best\nI think that\u2019s just an excuse, because their music ain't tight\nTell \u2018em that Ab-soul said it, they can quote him twice\nThen Crooked I came with Hip-Hop Weekly, killin\u2019 the internet\nBut he been a threat since Deathrow, then Roccett came about\nAnd all I thought about was Ab-Soul 2Eleven too\nIt finally started to look like the West was makin\u2019 moves\nWestern Union had the whole block boomin\u2019 because of Snoop\nMatter fact, Bad Lucc was my favorite about the group\nThen ?Problem? took off, another Compton native\nWe both Compton niggas, but Compton still ain't made it\nBy this time, Jay Rock and All My Life hit the airwaves\nWe almost got into some major beef over Lil\u2019 Wayne\nThat part I'mma leave out\nTheres certain things that the streets only should know about\nShout out to Nipsey\nBishop win that game, then had a fight with X.O\nThat\u2019s when I dropped C4 and had the critics mad at me\nBecause they didn\u2019t see my views, grab the hottest album out and re-do it\nThat\u2019s a goddamn power move stupid\nYou foolish, don\u2019t know shit about this war shit\nTheres mo\u2019 shit to wanting to be the king of the coast shit\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe\u2019s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu\nLook at the life that I been through\nWe the last real niggas alive, that\u2019s official\nLord have mercy, Jesus Christ\nHe\u2019s just nice, he just slice like a ginsu\nLook at the life that I been through\nWe the last real niggas alive, that\u2019s official\n\n[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]\nSo two weeks ago I finally run into the nigga I gave my mixtape too\nAnd said he was partners with Game\nThe nigga finally told me what he said\nHe said he didn\u2019t like it\nBut the niggas like\n\u201cSee, see, look at you, look at you now, I tried to tell him you was tight\u201d\nNigga probably never even gave it to him and shit\n\n[Ended with shout outs]5Embed"

You are somethin' like Wonder Woman\nAnd I just wanna hold your hand, bring you to Compton\nGonzales Park, we can build castles in the sand\nEatin' hot Cheetos with pickle juice in it\nPut that napkin down, you know I'll lick your fingers when you're finished\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThey say, \"Hello\" (Ayy), \"Hello\" (Ayy)\nI can daydream about Beyonc\u00e9 all day\nThinkin' 'bout the good times 'fore she met Jay\nSee ya know\nThey say, \"Hello\" (Ayy), \"Hello\" (Ayy)\nI really thought I had a chance to be your man\nUntil I seen the video with the ring on your hand\nIt hurt me so\n\n[Verse 2]\nI just bought the Sasha Fierce CD\nGazed at the cover for a whole 5 minutes, 'til my girlfriend hit me\nShe jealous of you, 'cause I don't love her like I love you\nI even make her do the \"uh-oh, uh-oh,\" just like you do\nShe tell me I'm obsessed, I tell her we connect\nLike Ice Cube way before the Mac 10 feud\nShe's like, \"You goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke\"\nI said, \"So? I'm only 500 mil' away, there's still hope\"\nAnyway, I had feelings even way before you got paid\nAnd I didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage\nAnd I salute Kanye for takin' up for you\nI would've stole the award just to prove that I love you\nBut Jay should've did that I thought he had your biz-ack\nWhat happened, Mr. Izzo?

Yep, they'd be sure to fight\nBetter yet, I'ma steal her cell, then call up Affion\nHe impersonates Jay well, get Beyonc\u00e9 on the line\nThen make up some bogus shit, like, \"You don't rub the back of my knees right\nSo this marriage is over with\nAnd the ring that's on my finger?

Wrong\nInsecurity roams the black community\nHomes where kids must have jewelry\nThe high school female need earrings and details\nSo she can be cool to be amongst popularity\nThe various name brands that reached the price scan\nIt's not about the right price but more like the right scam\nTo rule us all, confuse us all\nHit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw\nNow let's draw\nThe picture of a rapper with a chain and Range that is not paid for\nMy cousin from the South said he just bought him a house\nThat lives around his neck like a white collar\nSo why fast forward? Then I'll rewind, a time machine can help me double back to slavery times\nPickin' cotton from a field that a white man own\nThe blacker you are farther you from the white man's home\nNegro spiritual songs, gave us some type of sanity\nBefore your vanity, they parted our families\nThey put us in hundred degree shade and outside we bathed\nThe more we were afraid, the more they made rules\nAnd trapped our minds in a cage, our freedom was so vague\nCouldn't see it with the eyes of Tracee Ross, uh\nAnd school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts\nAnd a smirk could get you hurt, wounded first from a scar\nFour-hundred years of nothin', four-hundred years of sufferin'\nFour-hundred years of tears and tribulations, miseducation\nSee what we facin' is now comin' back to the roots\nRemember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot\nCalled us niggers and figured that we'd never live in pursuit\nOf happiness, we capture these feelings in things that we do\nThought of abstinence of slavery but we made it come to\nAbout a perspective, my shoe selection gotta be Louie\nHer hand bag gotta be Gucci, it's fake then she fool me\nShe still bad though and her fake Gucci ain't that bad though\nWe fillin' up the gas for Rollies\nUpgrade to twenty-sixes after ridin' Kobes\nMy cousin from the South, slavery start in the South and I bet ya\nHe overcompensate for the life of his ancestors\nSo blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw\nThe reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss\nSlaves\nYou might also like[Outro]\nI said the four-hundred years we never had nothin'\nBarely had clothes on our back\nIs the reason why when we get a little bit of change\nWe over exaggerate on our livin' expenses\nSo if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house\nYou're a vanity slave\nIf you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger\nFour holes in your left ear and a nose piercin'\nYou're a vanity slave\nIf you got an '02 Monte Carlo with twenty-fours on it\nAnd on the back of the window it says, \"Get on my level, ho\"\nYou're a vanity slave\nWe all vanity slaves\nSo with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at?\nI'm not from around here, hey, Ali, where we at?

Lyrics[Part I: \"Sing About Me\"]\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n[Verse 1]\nI woke up this morning and figured I'd call you\nIn case I'm not here tomorrow\nI'm hopin' that I can borrow\nA peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important\nMy mind is really distorted\nI find nothing but trouble in my life\nI'm fortunate you believe in a dream\nThis orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine\nAnd last night was just another distraction\nOr a reaction of what we consider madness\nI know exactly what happened\nYou ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help\nHeld him like a newborn baby and made him feel\nLike everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up\nBut the type of bullet that stuck\nHad went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands\nMy plan's rather vindictive\nEverybody's a victim in my eyes\nWhen I ride it's a murderous rhythm\nAnd outside became pitch black\nA demon glued to my back, whispering \"Get 'em!\"\nI got 'em and I ain't give a fuck\nThat same mentality I told my brother not to duck\nIn actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors\nI wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover\nThe life that I knew as a youngin\nIn pajamas and dun-ta-duns\nWhen thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb\nNiggas like me never prosper\nPrognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted\nThis Piru shit been in me forever\nSo forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever\nAnd I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did\nJust promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big\nAnd if I die before your album drop, I hope\u2014 [Gunshots]\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n[Verse 2]\nYou wrote a song about my sister on your tape\nAnd called it Section.80\nThe message resembled \"Brenda's Got a Baby\"\nWhat's crazy was I was hearin' about it\nBut doubted your ignorance\nHow could you ever just put her on blast and shit?\nJudgin' her past and shit?\nWell, it's completely my future\nHer nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit\nAnd I'ma need that forty dollars\nEven if I got to fuck, suck and swallow\nIn the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed\nBy a married man, and father of three\nMy titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys\nMatter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's\nHe got a cousin named David and I seen him last week\nThis is the life of another girl damaged by the system\nThese foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em\nSee, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em\nBack to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim\nOf a family gene that show women how to be woman\nOr better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'\nThen you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught\nThree niggas in one room, first time I was tossed\nAnd I'm exhausted, but fuck that \"Sorry for your loss\" shit\nMy sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain\nIf you can't fit the pumps I walk in?\nI'll wait\u2026 Your rebuttal a little too late\nAnd if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song\n'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own\nAnd matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?\nA doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight\nI'll probably live longer than you and never fade away\nI'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate\nAnd I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'\nI'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'\nYou lyin' to these motherfuckers\nTalkin' about you can help 'em with my story\nYou can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga\nDon't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit\u2026\n[Chorus]\nWhen the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Verse 3]\nSometimes I look in the mirror\nAnd ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?\nIf it's today, I hope I hear a\nCry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon\nWith the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus\nI wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'\nThe scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance\nWith the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed\nMay the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons\nI suffer a lot\nAnd every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch\nI tie my stomach in knots\nAnd I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death\nMy imagination is surely an aggravation of threats\nThat can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful\nAnd I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch\nMaybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death\nReally stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest\nAnd you're right, your brother was a brother to me\nAnd your sister's situation was the one that pulled me\nIn a direction to speak on somethin'\nThat's realer than the TV screen\nBy any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between\nHer personal life, I was like \"It need to be told\"\nCursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul\nExactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'\nOr steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's\nI count lives, all on these songs\nLook at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong\nFightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong\nAnd hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone\nAm I worth it? Did I put enough work in?\n[Chorus]\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\nI said when the lights shut off and it's my turn\nTo settle down, my main concern\nPromise that you will sing about me\nPromise that you will sing about me\n\n[Outro]\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\nPromise that you'll sing about me forever\nPromise that you'll sing about me for\u2014 ooooh\n[Part II: \"I'm Dying of Thirst\"]\n\n[Skit]\n(On the phone)\n\"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?\"\n\"Nigga, the homie's brother\u2014nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!\"\n\"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.\"\n\"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we\u2014nigga, we right here, my nigga.\"\n\"Bring a nigga back a black!\"\n\"Nigga\u2014bruh\u2014nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga.

That's mission impossible\nSo I never believed the type of performance that I could do\nI wasn't jealous cause of the talents they got\nI was terrified they'd be the last black boys to fly out of Compton\nThank God\n(Black boy fly, watch that black boy fly)78Embed"

We had a plan: Kendrick was going to give me a guided, cue-the-G-funk-synth Star Maps tour of his neighborhood, the one he still more or less lives in, starting at his parents' house a couple of blocks from his old high school, Centennial High, near the corner of Piru and South Central. Instead, he went AWOL. The whole day, no one from his label, Interscope, or Top Dawg Entertainment, the baby Death Row Records that originally signed him, could track him down. Kendrick was gone.\n\nIt turned out he was sitting shivah for a murdered friend he calls his \"little bro\"\u2014a kid from a neighborhood where friendship is defined primarily by neighborhood. A few weeks earlier, Chad Keaton, 23, had been wounded in a drive-by shooting very close to Kendrick's parents' house. He held on for a month but ultimately died of complications from the gunshot wounds.\n\nSo today, here on board this Challenger 300 seven-seater, en route to New York City's fall Fashion Week, a destination filled with people Kendrick isn't sure whether he wants to impress or fuck with, he's telling me about Chad. \"It all happened when I was overseas,\" he says. \"I had to talk to him over Skype on the hospital bed before he passed.\"\n\nIt's been a strange year. When it began, Kendrick was already regarded as something of a messiah among rap nerds\u2014one of the best rappers ever to come out of the place that has produced many of the best rappers ever\u2014and since then his legend has spread fast.\n\nIt actually began late last year, when Kendrick's major-label-debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city,dropped, to universal acclaim. The album\u2014about a day in the life of nerdy Compton teenager K.Dot and his homeys as they run around in his mom's minivan chasing \"that crazy-ass girl Sherane\"\u2014is practically a black Ulysses: a portrait of the rapper as a young man, simultaneously a drive-by deconstruction of gangster rap's violent tropes and a celebration of its signature, slow-rolling sound. On good kid, Lamar is our embedded correspondent, spitting triple-time confessionals from a part of the country most of us had forgotten once the rap scene found a fresher inner city to fetishize. He's the game's most linguistically cerebral MC, but also its realest\u2014the one who finds the most vivid way to tell a story about his unemployed buddies trying to rope him into robbing some dude's house\u2014and it's this polarity that makes listening to King Kendrick feel like you're putting on the illest 3-D glasses in hip-hop. The music nods at influences far beyond the West Coast\u2014Beach House samples, Dungeon Family lushness\u2014but throughout, his voice stays singularly focused on a twenty-block radius around Central Avenue and Piru Street:If Pirus and Crips all got along They'd probably gun me down by the end of this songGood kid, m.A.A.d city sold an industry-shocking 241,000 copies its first week and went platinum this summer. Then, in August, Kendrick snuck a sixty-four-bar Trojan horse into his buddy Big Sean's song \"Control\"\u2014a guest spot on a song that didn't even make the final record. After Big Sean goes on for a while about drinking champagne in Detroit, Kendrick wakes up the entire hip-hop universe, calling out nearly every single young rapper in the game: Drake; A$AP Rocky; J. Cole; Tyler, the Creator; even Big Sean himself. The dude slaps Sean on his own song. He also proclaimed himself \"the king of New York,\" which to certain East Coast ears sounded like a Greek dude strolling into Troy and dropping a deuce on the tomb of Hector.\n\n\"Control\" leaked on YouTube late in the day on August 12; for a solid week, it was the biggest story in music. Just a few weeks after that, Kanye announced he was touring solo for the first time in five years and that his opening act would be Kendrick Lamar.\n\nKendrick's career momentum has created a dissonance that must look surreal from 30,000 feet. Chad Keaton's memorial service was held just before Labor Day weekend; Kendrick attended, then flew straight to a show in Alaska. Next it was on to Vegas to perform at a pool party. He only made it \"back to the set\" to grieve for a single day, the day we were scheduled to talk. \"It can be complicated and confusing,\" Kendrick says of his life right now, funerals for murdered friends one day, private jets to fashion parties the next. \"From my perspective, it's not just I'm famous\u2014I still live in this world.\" And when someone back home needs something, \"I still gotta get that phone call.\"\n\nIt's clear the emotions are still raw. Kendrick is a small guy, just five feet six, and with his black hood pulled up over his head, a chain around the outside of his sweatshirt, it felt like I was talking to a wizened rap Jedi. After about an hour of questions, I gave him a break, and he lay down on the couch to rest. Just kind of curled up with his back turned.\n\nA bit later, I saw a tweet from him to his 2.4 million followers pop up on my phone: \"When the cameras stop rolling, it doesn't mean real life will follow.\" Instantly it had fifty-six retweets. After one minute, 600. After two minutes, 1,000. Then he tweeted a picture of Chad: \"Rest N Heaven my Lil bro. Watched u become a man. U fought bro. The city stole yo life, but not your legacy.\"\n\nOn the night of the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, just as the heat over \"Control\" was peaking, I tailed Kendrick through the backstage maze at Brooklyn's Barclays Center. At one point, he ran into Drake, and they wrapped each other up in a big hug. It was their first encounter since Kendrick called him out on \"Control,\" and of all the slaps in that verse, this one felt the most personal, because Drake had helped break Kendrick, handing the kid not just a verse but an entire song on his second album. After Drake's VMA performance of \"Hold On, We're Going Home,\" Kendrick made his way back to the greenroom, crooning the hook: I got my eyes on you.... He caught mine and smiled. \"You watch,\" he joked, \"I'm going to be singing by my fifth album!\"\n\nI asked if this meant things were cool between him and Drake. He paused. \"Pretty cool.\" Shrugs. \"And I mean, I would be okay if we weren't.\"\nA month later, it became apparent that things between Kendrick and Drake were definitely not cool. After Drake's new album dropped, he gave a pair of interviews in which he sounded wounded by the \"Control\" thing: \"You can't just say that and then see me and be like, 'Yeah, man, what's up?'\u2014pretending like nothing ever happened.\" Seemingly in response, during the BET Hip-Hop Awards cypher a few weeks later, Kendrick freestyled: Nothing been the same since they dropped \"Control\" / and tucked a sensitive rapper back in his pajama clothes.\n\nI got Kendrick on the phone after the BET taping, and he admitted to being surprised by Drizzy's public lash-out\u2014\"Control\" named names, sure, but at its core it was a backhanded tribute to the peers Kendrick actually gives a shit about. Most of them took it in that spirit. Not Drake. \"Yeah, I guess he took it as a dis,\" Kendrick said, downplaying talk of a beef. But he was also clear that he doesn't look up to Drake, doesn't see him as any kind of creative influence. When I asked if Drake was a mentor or a role model, he replied quickly, \"No\u2014peer. If anything. We all peers.\"\n\nWhen Kendrick Lamar was 21, 2Pac appeared to him in a vision. Before you roll your eyes, Lamar wants you to know that he's not the hermit-on-the-edge-of-the-Nitrian-Desert, vision-seeing type. He knows how this sounds.\n\n\"I was coming from a late studio session, sleeping on Mom's couch. I'm 26 now\u2014it wasn't that long ago. I remember being tired, tripping from the studio, lying down, and falling into a deep sleep and seeing a vision of Pac talking to me. Weirdest shit ever. I'm not huge on superstition and all that shit. That's what made it so crazy. It can make you go nuts. Hearing somebody that you looked up to for years saying, 'Don't let the music die.' Hearing it clear as day. Clear as day. Like he's right there. Just a silhouette.\"\n\nThe visit from Pac changed Kendrick's connection to the world he was chronicling in his music and compelled him to think more carefully about who was listening to it. \"It wasn't just about money, hoes, clothes, drinkin',\" he explains. \"I mean, I come from that world, but at the same time, I started to realize that there's people out there that can't really connect to that lifestyle. They're in the struggle.\"\n\nMuch of Kendrick's music now is an attempt to transcend his ravaged world without separating himself from it in judgment, about somehow gaining control over his household's chaos\u2014some of his uncles were Crips, and his father was reportedly a Gangster Disciple in Chicago before moving to Compton\u2014and over his neighborhood's warped commitment to adolescent pride. It's an ethos that extends to his crew. They have a seriousness of purpose, a rigorous discipline that can feel slightly monastic at times. Kendrick doesn't smoke weed or drink booze. In the time I spent with him, I never witnessed anyone roll even the thinnest spider leg of a jay, nor did I see Kendrick so much as glance at the many, many girls around him. \"When I ask OGs why there's so much division in the streets\u2014nobody never really knows,\" he says. \"But you know one thing that everybody always mention? A woman.\"\n\nA few hours after the VMAs, we were back in Kendrick's hotel room and everybody was in a lull, staring at cell phones, waiting for news about afterparties. A plan coalesced to hit a party being thrown by Diddy at the Dream Downtown hotel. But one of Kendrick's Top Dawg boys leaned back and said, \"Aw, man, I can't go to no club.\"\n\nKendrick spoke up.\n\n\"We have to go.\"\n\n\"Look at you! We have to go. You're never we have to go.\"\n\n\"You know me,\" Kendrick explained. \"I only go when there's a point. Usually the point is just niggas drinking. But walking through the club the week after I released the 'Control' verse? That's a point!\"\n\nTwenty minutes later, Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, basically TDE's Suge Knight, asked if I had had a fun day. I said that I had and that I was surprised by their discipline. \"You guys seem so calm,\" I said.\n\n\"Well,\" Tiffith told me, \"we're going to have to call it a night with you, because we about to get uncalm. You understand.\"The gossip from Diddy's Ciroc Amaretto Launch Party/VMA Afterparty sounded like it fell out of a massive tear in the mid-'90s West Coast-East Coast time wave. Bloggers breathlessly recounted a surreal scene at Dream: booths packed with hip-hop illuminati\u2014Jay, Bey\u2014mouths agape as a wasted Diddy, incensed by the \"King of New York\" boast, attempted to pour a drink (Ciroc Amaretto, presumably) over Kendrick's head, only to be thwarted by Jay Z acolyte J. Cole, who was kicked out in the ensuing chaos. Naturally Kendrick himself refused to corroborate any of this. \"It was all love at that party,\" he told me on the private jet.\nAfter we land at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, I catch a ride with Kendrick into Manhattan. His show tonight is a New York Fashion Week kickoff party in Chelsea thrown by industry doyenne Jenn\u00e9 Lombardo, and in the car he goofs around, imagining the horror he and his Compton homeys could inspire: \"We invited Kendrick Lamar, not K.Dot and them Piru niggas.\"\n\nBy the end of his forty-minute set, the crowd is pretty fucked-up. There's chronic in the air; models are tottering in their heels. When Kendrick launches into the call-and-response for \"Swimming Pools (Drank),\" a song about his family's dark relationship with chemical dependency\u2014Head shot. DRANK. Sit down. DRANK. Stand up. DRANK\u2014a wraithlike six-foot blonde with a white veil dances around a little coven of models. There is something demonic about the scene: Kendrick recounting his fever dreams about the grim consequences of decadence while presiding over a decadent Fashion Week party.\n\nIt's hard to guess how scenes like this will change Kendrick and his music. Sometime in January, he will step into Top Dawg's booth again, and he expects to be just as surprised as the rest of us by what comes out. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"It depends on where my emotion is. How angry I'll be, or how happy I'll be, or how confused I'll be.\"\n\nAt one point on good kid Kendrick raps, \"I can feel the changes / I can feel a new life / I always knew life can be dangerous\". The biggest change in Kendrick's life is the inversion of rap's consummate observer becoming the observed. How will all eyez on him affect his art? Because he's already 10,000 feet above Compton, and rising.14Embed"

(They want us to bow)\nI want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)\nSome white, somethin' black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)\nI hate everything black (We don't believe)\nBlack, I want all things black\nI don't need black, I want everything black\nI don't need black, our eyes ain't black\nI own black, I own everything black\n\n[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]\nSix in the morn'\nFire in the street\nBurn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)\nThat's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)\nAnd sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain\nIt's such a shame, they may call me crazy\nThey may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'\nBut homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)\nBlack don't crack, my nigga\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nBeen feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses\nYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it\nI'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter

dead, church me with your fake prophesizing\nThat I'ma be just another slave in my head\nInstitutionalized manipulation and lies\nReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\nYou hate me, don't you?\nI know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\nJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\nWatchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out\nMuscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah\nBlack and successful, this black man meant to be special\nKatzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?\nHow can I tell you I'm making a killin'?\nYou made me a killer,

will agree\nThis plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred\nIt's genocism, it's grimy, little justification\nI'm African-American, I'm African\nI'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan\nI'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French\nBut fuck you \u2014 no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets\nI know you hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you\nI can tell 'cause your ways deceitful\nKnow I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle\nThinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him\nIt's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\nTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroy\nRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\nBeefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score\nSo don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\nOr tell Georgia State \"Marcus Garvey got all the answers\"\nOr try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET 'cause urban support is important\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite!\n[Instrumental Outro]\n[Produced by Boi-1da & Koz]1.6KEmbed"

was conflicted\nMisusing your influence\nSometimes I did the same\nAbusing my power, full of resentment\nResentment that turned into a deep depression\nFound myself screaming in the hotel room\nI didn't wanna self destruct\nThe evils of Lucy was all around me\nSo I went running for answers\nUntil I came home\nBut that didn't stop survivor's guilt\nGoing back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned\nOr maybe how A-1 my foundation was\nBut while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city\nI was entering a new one\nA war that was based on apartheid and discrimination\nMade me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned\nThe word was respect\nJust because you wore a different gang color than mine's\nDoesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man\nForgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets\nIf I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us\nBut I don't know, I'm no mortal man\nMaybe I'm just another nigga\u201d\nShit and that's all I wrote\nI was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain't really a poem\nI just felt like it's something you probably could relate to\nOther than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you\nI always wanted to ask you about a certain situa-\nAbout a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground\nWhat you mean by that, what the ground represent?\nThe ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil\nRight\nThat's how I see it, my word is bond\nI see\u2014and the ground is the symbol for the poor people\nRight\nThe poor people is gonna open up this whole world\nAnd swallow up the rich people\n'Cause the rich people gonna be so fat\nAnd they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm saying Wealthy, appetizing\nThe poor gonna be so poor, and hungry\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna be\nThere might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu-\nThey might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?\nAight so let me ask you this then\nDo you see yourself as somebody that's rich\nOr somebody that made the best of they own opportunities?\nI see myself as a natural born hustler\nA true hustler in every sense of the word\nI took nothin', I took the opportunities\nI worked at the most menial and degrading job\nAnd built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it\nI went from having somebody managing me\nTo me hiring the person that works my management company\nI changed everything, I realized my destiny\nIn a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying?\nI made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people\nNow it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying?\nI made millions for the record companies\nI made millions for these movie companies\nNow I make millions for, for us\nAnd through your different avenues of success\nHow would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?\nBy my faith in God, by my faith in the game\nAnd by my faith in \"all good things come to those that stay true\"\nRight\nYou know what I'm saying?\nAnd it was happening to me for a reason\nYou know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit\nI was punching the right buttons and it was happening\nSo it's no problem, you know\nI mean, it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know\nI'm finna go straight through\nWould you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that\nSomebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?\nShit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh Threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance\nAnd not only me but, it goes down my family tree\nYou know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back\nAight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like\n\"We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win\nAnd I wanna lay it all down\"\nIn this country, a black man only have like\nFive years we can exhibit maximum strength\nAnd that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong\nWhile you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back\n'Cause once you turn thirty it's like\nThey take the heart and soul out of a man\nOut of a black man, in this country\nAnd you don't wanna fight no more\nAnd if you don't believe me, you can look around\nYou don't see no loud mouth thirty-year old motherfuckers\nThat's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings\nOf the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that\nThere's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I wanted to ask you\nWhat you think is the future for me and my generation today?\nI think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores\nAnd next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed\nFor real, I don't think America know that\nI think America think we was just playing\nAnd it's gonna be some more playing but\nIt ain't gonna be no playing\nIt's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying?\nIt's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker\nYou know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen\nThat's crazy, man, in my opinion\nOnly hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations\nLot a people don't understand how important it is, you know\nSometimes I can like, get behind a mic\nAnd I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out\nOr where it comes from, trip me out sometimes\nBecause it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin'\nWe just letting our dead homies tell stories for us\nDamn\nI wanted to read one last thing to you\nIt's actually something a good friend had wrote\nDescribing my world, it says:\n\u201cThe caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe's trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same\"\nWhat's your perspective on that?\nPac?

Kendrick Lamar EP. Kendrick Lamar OD. Section-mothefucking-.80. Real shit. This is cool right here goddamn, this is really cool right now. This about real shit, listen up. To Pimp a Butterfly. People said a lot about this album. That'd said album of the year, that' said album of this generation and all that shit. That's cool, but also real shit making this motherfucking album was therapy. Not only for you, but for me, You know what I'm saying? Because within six months of good kid, m.A.A.d city dropping, the life of what I knew, when I knew what it was, thinking I knew, that completely changed within six months. And uh, you going through the motional of the world telling you that you're great. And you trying to make yourself believe that shit, but it's hard because you're institutionalized from where you come from. Still trying to move around and stay the way I like I do. I'm a low-key nigga. And I ain't scared of the world. Me personally, I can't run around with a hundred niggas like I usually do. I don't need to, I don't want to. And that's just been me since day one. So trying to grasp the idea of them telling you who you should run with, it can't cut it. Because like I said on the Kendrick Lamar EP, \"I need to be me goddamnit\". I think this shit can live forever, but looking at y'all faces y'all just. I got some of the most loyal. dedicated motherfucking fans in the world (?). (?) I could talk all day (?). To Pimp a Butterfly. Y'all allowed this motherfucking album has soared all the way to the top with no motherfucking commercial success. Y'all allowed it to be top-tier without a constant radio single and shit. So that proves to you right there, music is not something you can motherfucking market all the time. This shit belong to you and you only, you know what I'm saying? Some shit that y\u2019all can feel whether you insecure, whether you vulnerable, whether you mad, happy, angry, sad. You pop this motherfucking tape in, you pop your favorite music in, and you love and you live that shit. And you allow artists like me myself to come back to these group of people and perform the shit that I want to perform, you dig what I'm saying? This may be the first and last time I perform To Pimp a Butterfly on this run. Eight of the ten cities. And I made sure New York be one of them cities that I come back to to do this shit.

Lamar]\nAs I get a little older, I realize life is perspective\nAnd my perspective may differ from yours\nI wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me\nAll my fans, all\u205fmy\u205fbeautiful\u205ffans\nAnyone who's ever\u205fgave me a\u205flisten, all my people\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor\nRebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer\nBelt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence\nMake the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment\nResidue burned, mist of the inner-city\nMiscommunication to keep homi' detective busy\nNo protection is risky\nDesensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged\nGet used to hearin' arsenal rain\nAnalyze, risk your life, take the charge\nHomies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard\nThat's culture\nTwenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called\nSaid your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved\nI done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house\nGet out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed\nCar wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed\nA brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams\nThe culture\nYou might also like[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar with Marvin Gaye]\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI said I do this for my culture\nTo let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover\nIn my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper\nHair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'\nFriends bipolar, grab you by your pockets\nNo option if you froze up, always play the offense\nNiggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work\nWorkin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork\nThat's the culture, point the finger, promote ya\nRemote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya\nThe streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me\nI wanna represent for us\nNew revolution was up and movin'\nI'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion\nWater in between us, another peer's been executed\nHistory repeats again\nMake amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it\nBut that's the culture, crack a bottle\nHard to deal with the pain when you're sober\nBy tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over\nThat's the problem\nOur foundation was trained to accept whatever follows\nDehumanized, insensitive\nScrutinize the way we live for you and I\nEnemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you\nIn the land where no equal is your equal\nNever say I ain't told ya, nah\nIn the land where hurt people hurt more people\nFuck callin' it culture\n[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar with Marvin Gaye]\n(I want, I want, I want, I want)\nBut I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)\nI want the hood\nLook what I done for you (Look what I done for you)\nLook what I done for you\n\n[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]\nTake the drums out\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nCelebrate new life when it come back around\nThe purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now\nSacrifice personal gain over everything\nJust to see the next generation better than ours\nI wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered\nTemptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures\nI felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry\nBut all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent\nFace your fears, always knew that I would make it here\nWhere the energy is magnified and persevered\nConsciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear\nEuphoria is glorified and made His\nReflectin' on my life and what I done\nPaid dues, made rules, change outta love\nThem same views made schools change curriculums\nBut didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun\nShould I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?\nShould I feel regret about the good that I was into?\nEverything is everything, this ain't coincidental\nI woke up that morning with more heart to give you\nAs I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence\nTo my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven\nTo my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven\nTo my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven\nTo my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings\nTo my fans, make sure you make them investments\nAnd to the killer that sped up my demise\nI forgive you, just know your soul's in question\nI seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed\nAnd though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved\nI completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave\nBut fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased\nI can't stress how I love y'all\nI don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all\nThe memories recollect just because y'all\nCelebrate me with respect\nThe unity we protect is above all\nAnd Sam, I'll be watchin' over you\nMake sure my kids watch all my interviews\nMake sure you live out our dreams we produced\nKeep that genius in your brain on the move\nAnd to my neighborhood, let the good prevail\nMake sure them babies and the leaders outta jail\nLook for salvation when troubles get real\n'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself\nAnd I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed\nY'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel\nAnd though my physical won't reap the benefits\nThe energy that carry on emits still\nI want you201Embed"

human beings\n\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nMotorola pager, off-white Guess jacket\nBlue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits\n'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest\nBig social, big personality, vocal\nPlayed the underground verbatim and stayed local\nMy auntie is a man now\nI watch him and his girl hold their hands down\nTip of the avenues under street lights made his\nThinking, \"I want me a bad bitch when I get big\"\nThey hug on the corner like California King\nCold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road\nSee, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado\nScratching the likes from lotto\nHoping that she pull up tomorrow\nSo I can hang out in the front seat\nSix-by-nines keeping the music up under me\nMy auntie is a man now\nAsked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much\nAnd at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much\nShe said, \"Ain't no tellin'\nNiggas always been jealous because he had more women\nMore money and more attention made more envy\nCalling him anything but broke was less offending\"\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nMy auntie is a man now\nI think I'm old enough to understand now\nDrinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards\nBack when it was comedic relief to say, \"Faggot\"\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nElementary kids with no filter, however\nMy auntie became a man and I took pride in it\nShe wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference\nThat's what I told my friends in second grade\nShe picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face\nThey couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed\nWe pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing\nMy auntie is a man now, what a relationship\nI grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit\nHe gave me some cash then gave me some game\nCherry freshener on the dash, I never complained\nShe even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade\nThe first person I seen write a rap\nThat's when my life had changed\nHouse full of demo, smoke stuck on the window\nCameras on the microphone, all women and men know\nMy auntie was a man now, we cool with it\nThe history had trickled down and made us ign'ant\nMy favorite cousin said he's returning the favor\nAnd following my auntie with the same behavior\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nHe's more confident to live his plan now (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nBut the family in disbelief this time (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nConvincing themselves, \"He ain't living discreet, he's fine\" (Talking to the world's gonna bring you down)\nThey said they never seen it in him, but I seen it (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nThe Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\nHe built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over\nHe didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)\n\"Faggot, faggot, faggot,\" we ain't know no better\nMiddle school kids with no filter, however\nI had to be very mindful of my good cousin\nI knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nI mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further\nChanged his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain\nLiving his truth even if it meant see a surgeon\nWe didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant\nWasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive\nBut I recall we both had a sick sense of humor\nMade raw, but time changes all\n\n[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]\nDemetrius is Mary-Ann now\nRemember church, Easter Sunday?\nI sat in the pew, you had stronger faith\nMore spiritual when these dudes were living life straight\nWhich I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same\nHe said my cousin was going through some things\nHe promised the world we living in was an act on abomination\nAnd Demetrius was to blame\nI knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman\nWondering if God still call you a decent man\nStill, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint\nUntil he singled you out to prove his point, saying\n\"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now\nChurch, his auntie is a man now,\" it hurt\nYou the most 'cause your belief was close to his words\nForcing me to stand now\nI said, \"Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?\nThe laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?\nI recognize the study she was taught since birth\nBut that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved\"\nThe building was thinking out loud, bad angel\nThat's when you looked at me and smiled, said, \"Thank you\"\nThe day I chose humanity over religion\nThe family got closer, it was all forgiven\nI said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better\nMistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different\nSee, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound\nIf ever they was pronounced without any intentions\nThe very second you challenged the shit I was kicking\nReminded me about a show I did out the city\nThat time I brung a fan on stage to rap\nBut disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me\nYou said, \"Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction\nTo truly understand love, switch position\n'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together\nBut only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'\"48Embed"
